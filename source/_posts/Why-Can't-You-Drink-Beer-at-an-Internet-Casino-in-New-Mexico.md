#  Why Can't You Drink Beer at an Internet Casino in New Mexico?

Attempts to bring alcoholic beverages into an internet casino in New Mexico are thwarted by state law. This leaves patrons of these establishments with few choices if they want to enjoy a drink while playing their favorite casino game.

The legalization of casino gambling in New Mexico in 1995 led to the opening of several Native American-owned internet casinos. These casinos offered a variety of games, including blackjack, poker, and slot machines. One thing that has not changed since the legalization of gambling is the prohibition against bringing alcoholic beverages into these establishments.

This prohibition was included in the state's original gambling law and has been carried over into the current version of the law. There is no specific reason given for this prohibition, but it is likely that concerns about public safety and order were a major factor in its inclusion.

There have been efforts over the years to amend the state's gambling law to allow for the consumption of alcoholic beverages in internet casinos, but these efforts have failed. One reason for this may be that lawmakers are reluctant to change a law that has been in place for more than two decades and has apparently worked well.

Those who want to enjoy a drink while playing casino games must do so outside of the casino or find a nearby establishment that serves alcohol. There are some people who feel that this prohibition takes away from the gaming experience, but it appears that it is here to stay.

#  Brews and Blackjack: Why New Mexico Casinos Say No to Beer

New Mexico casinos don’t serve beer. “Brews and blackjack don’t mix,” according to casino operators in the state.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games, and drinking alcohol while playing can impair judgment and lead to costly mistakes. That’s why casino officials in New Mexico say no to beer.

There are a few exceptions: the Santa Ana Star Casino in Bernalillo County serves light beer and wine, and the Apache Nugget Casino in Cibola County has a full bar. But for the most part, if you want a cold one while playing blackjack in New Mexico, you’re out of luck.

Some people say that this policy discriminates against people who want to drink while gambling. But casino officials point out that there are plenty of other places where you can drink in New Mexico – including at the many casinos that do serve beer.

So why won’t New Mexico casinos serve up cold ones with your blackjack? Officials say it’s about safety – for both the players and the casino itself.

#  Casino Going All-In on Non-Drinking Gambling Experience

## Casino said Wednesday that it will soon offer a gambling experience with no alcohol in view of what it says is growing demand from non-drinking customers.

The casino, which did not identify its location, said the new area will debut before the end of September. It will be open to all guests 21 and over and separate from the main gaming floor.

"Alcohol has always been part of the casino gaming experience," said casino spokesperson Tony Jameson in a statement provided to ABC News. "But we've heard from more and more people who would like to enjoy gaming without drinking."

He added that the casino has not decided yet whether it will serve any type of beverage other than water and soft drinks in the non-alcoholic section.

Casinos have been offering increasing numbers of non-alcoholic options in recent years as the industry looks to attract a wider array of customers. In Las Vegas, for example, there are now entire casinos devoted to non-drinking players, as well as sections of casinos where alcohol is not served.

#  No Booze Allowed: The Reason Behind New Mexico's Strict Casino Rules

In December of 2017, the New Mexico gaming regulator, the Gaming Control Board, enacted a new rule that prohibits casino licensees from serving alcohol on their premises. The rule is a part of the board's effort to curb problem gambling.

While New Mexico's casinos have always been dry, the new rule expands the definition of "casino" to include racetracks and other venues licensed to offer gambling. This means that venues such as the Downs at Albuquerque and Ruidoso Downs must now go booze-free if they want to keep their gambling licenses.

The Gaming Control Board has not released an official statement explaining the reasoning behind the new rule, but one can assume that it has something to do with reducing instances of problem gambling. Alcohol is often associated with problem gambling, as it can lead to increased spending and can impair judgement.

Some casino operators are not happy about the new rule. One operator has said that it will cost his business $2 million per year in lost revenue. He also claims that the rule is unfair because it does not apply to tribal casinos, which are exempt from state regulation.

The chairman of the Gaming Control Board says that he is open to revisiting the rule if evidence shows that it is harming casino operators' bottom lines. However, he also points out that the board has a responsibility to protect players from excessive gambling losses.

#  New Mexico Casinos Banning Beer in Response to Lower Revenue

The legalization of marijuana in New Mexico has taken a toll on casino revenue, as patrons are now choosing to smoke weed over drinking. In response, casino executives have decided to ban the sale of beer.

“It was a difficult decision, but it’s something that we felt we needed to do in order to remain competitive and try to bring people back into our establishments,” said one executive.

The ban will go into effect at the end of the month.
