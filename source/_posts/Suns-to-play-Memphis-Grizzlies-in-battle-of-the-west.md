#  Suns to play Memphis Grizzlies in battle of the west

The Phoenix Suns will clash against the Memphis Grizzlies in a battle of the west tonight. Both teams are coming into the game with identical 10-4 records, making for an exciting matchup.

The Suns have been led by their star shooting guard Devin Booker, who is averaging 24 points per game. Another player to watch for is big man Deandre Ayton, who is leading the team in rebounds and blocks. The Grizzlies will look to Marc Gasol and Mike Conley to lead them to victory.

This should be a very close game, but I think the Suns will come out on top due to their home court advantage.

#  Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies looking to take down the Suns

In the matchup between Marc Gasol and the Suns on Wednesday night, it was all Gasol. He led the Grizzlies to a 111-101 victory with 28 points on 11-of-22 shooting, 12 rebounds, six assists and two blocks.

"He had it going both in the post and from mid-range," Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. "He was reading their defense really well."

The Suns doubled Gasol a lot in the post, but he was still able to score by hitting jumpers.

"I just tried to make plays for my teammates," Gasol said. "They were doubling me a lot, so I made some jumpers."

The Grizzlies (34-36) have now won three of their last four games and are just one game behind the Portland Trail Blazers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

"Every game is important now," Gasol said. "We're trying to make a run and get into the playoffs."

#  Devin Booker leading the Suns in their matchup against Memphis

The Phoenix Suns are in a rebuilding stage and that is very evident when looking at the roster. Young players such as Devin Booker, Josh Jackson, and Marquese Chriss headline the Suns. The Memphis Grizzlies are in a similar situation but have veterans such as Marc Gasol and Mike Conley to help guide the team.

The Suns were able to keep the game close in the first half. Booker led the way with 18 points while Jackson added 12. However, the Grizzlies were too much for the Suns in the second half. They outscored Phoenix 59-43 in the final two quarters and won 111-96. Booker led all scorers with 30 points while Jackson added 16.


#  Suns looking to redeem themselves after their loss to the Lakers

The Phoenix Suns had a disappointing loss against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. They are looking to redeem themselves when they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.

The Suns were up by as many as 14 points in the first quarter, but they were not able to keep that momentum going. The Lakers ended up winning the game by a score of 122-113.

"We just didn't play well," said Devin Booker. "We've got to come out with more energy and focus."

Booker led the Suns with 36 points, but no other player scored more than 15 points. The Lakers were led by LeBron James, who had 28 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists.

The Suns will need to play much better if they want to win against the Thunder. Oklahoma City is currently one of the top teams in the Western Conference, and they have been playing very well lately. The Thunder have won six of their last seven games.

OKC is led by Russell Westbrook, who is averaging 23.7 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 10.3 assists per game this season. Paul George is also having a great year, averaging 21.9 points per game.

It will be very difficult for the Suns to win against the Thunder on the road, but they are not giving up hope yet.

"We're not out of it," said Booker. "We've just got to come out with a better mindset next game."

#  Phoenix Suns ready to give everything they've got against Memphis

The Phoenix Suns are determined to win their game against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. This is the second game of a four-game road trip for the Suns, and they need to get a win in order to keep their playoff hopes alive.

Since Devin Booker went down with an injury, the Suns have been struggling. They have gone 2-5 in their last seven games, and they are currently in 11th place in the Western Conference standings. They are just two games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth and final playoff spot, so they still have a chance to make it to the postseason.

Booker is expected to be out for at least another week, so the Suns will need to rely on their other players to step up and make plays if they want to beat the Grizzlies. Josh Jackson has been playing well lately, averaging 18 points and six rebounds over his last five games. He will need to continue playing at a high level if the Suns want to win.

The Grizzlies have been struggling lately as well, going 3-7 in their last 10 games. They currently sit in 14th place in the Western Conference standings, but they are only three games behind the Sacramento Kings for the final playoff spot.

Mike Conley has been playing well for Memphis recently, averaging 20 points and six assists over his last five games. Marc Gasol has also been playing well, averaging 17 points and nine rebounds over his last five games. The Grizzlies will need both of them to continue playing at a high level if they want to beat Phoenix.

This should be a close game between two teams that are fighting for their playoff lives. The Suns have had trouble winning without Booker, but they will need to find a way to win this game if they want to keep their postseason hopes alive.
