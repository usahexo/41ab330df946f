#  Poker Face Lenz Never Shows His Hand!

In poker, “marking your cards” means to change the appearance of your cards so that the other players cannot see what you have. Some people do this by bending their cards or by changing the way they hold them. However, the most common way to mark your cards is by hiding them in a certain way. One popular technique is to put a chip or a coin on top of your cards so that you can keep track of them. This is also known as “poker face” because it allows you to keep a straight face even if you are losing badly.

By refusing to reveal his cards, Lenz forces his opponents to make guesses about what he might have. This often causes them to make mistakes and gives Lenz an advantage over them.

Although Lenz never shows his hand, he occasionally gives away clues about what he might have. For example, he may talk about the hands he has been dealt in previous rounds or he may act nervously when he has a good hand. By watching for these clues, the other players can get an idea of what Lenz might be holding.
