#  Duck and Ski – A New Twist on an Old Favorite!

Duck and ski is a game that has been around since the early 1800s. It was a popular game among the wealthy elite of the time. However, the game has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years as people have sought to find new and unique ways to enjoy old favorites.

The basic premise of duck and ski is simple: players use a set of skis to move across a frozen lake or pond, while avoiding ducks that are swimming in the water. The first player to reach the other end of the lake or pond (or the player who manages to avoid the most ducks) wins the game.

While the original version of duck and ski was played on a frozen lake or pond, players can now enjoy the game on a variety of surfaces, including ice rinks, snow-covered fields, and even indoor arenas. In addition, players can use a variety of different methods to move across the surface, including skating, skiing, running, and even sledding.

Despite its simple premise, duck and ski can be a challenging game. Players must constantly be aware of their surroundings while trying to avoid being hit by ducks. As such, it can be an exciting game for both children and adults alike.
