#  Casino has Age Limit of 18+

The casino industry is full of fun and excitement, but it’s also a world where adults only are allowed. That’s because the casino has an age limit of 18+.

This isn’t some arbitrary number that casinos decided on out of the blue. There’s actually a very good reason for why the age limit is 18+. Casino gaming is all about strategy and making calculated decisions. That takes experience and maturity – something that most people don’t obtain until they reach adulthood.

Casinos want to make sure that everyone who steps into their establishment is able to make informed decisions. That’s why the age limit is in place – to protect players and ensure that everyone has a good time.

While there are some exceptions, in general, the age limit at casinos is 18+. If you’re not quite old enough yet, don’t worry – there’s plenty of time to enjoy the casino experience when you reach adulthood!

#  18 is the Minimum Age to Enter FortuneFactory

FortuneFactory, a Los Angeles-based online game development studio, has announced that it is raising the minimum age requirement for new players from 17 to 18.

The change, which goes into effect on January 1, 2019, was made in an effort to improve the overall player experience and protect younger players from potential negative consequences associated with gambling behavior.

“increasing the minimum age requirement is something we’ve been considering for some time now, and we ultimately decided that it was in the best interest of our players,” said FortuneFactory CEO John Riccitiello. “We want to ensure that all our players have a positive experience on our platform, and we believe this change will help us achieve that goal.”

The move comes as the debate surrounding loot boxes and their potential for gambling continues to heat up. In recent months, several governments around the world have begun investigating whether or not games containing loot boxes should be regulated in the same way as traditional gambling products.

FortuneFactory is not the only company to make changes in light of these concerns. Earlier this year, Ubisoft announced that it would remove all microtransactions from its games targeted at children and teens. And in October, Disney pulled its games with microtransactions from sale in Belgium following concerns about gambling addiction.
