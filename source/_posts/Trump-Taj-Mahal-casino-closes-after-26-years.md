#  Trump Taj Mahal casino closes after 26 years

The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has closed its doors permanently after 26 years of operation. The closure is a result of the casino's parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filing for bankruptcy protection in February.

Around 3,000 employees will be affected by the closure, which is one of the largest mass layoffs in Atlantic City's history. The Trump Taj Mahal is the fifth casino to close in Atlantic City since 2014.

In a statement announcing the closure, CEO Robert Griffin said that "the Taj is simply not sustainable in its present form." He added that the company had made every effort to keep the casino open, but ultimately decided that it was no longer viable.

The Trump Taj Mahal was opened by Donald Trump in 1990 and was the largest and mostexpensive casino in the world at the time. However, it quickly began to struggle as new casinos opened in other states.

Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 2009, and again in 2014. In both cases, Donald Trump himself was not involved in the company and had no ownership stake.

The casino's closure will come as a blow to Atlantic City's already struggling economy. The city has seen its share of casino closures in recent years as gambling competition has increased from other states.

#  Casino Wildz to take over Trump Taj Mahal

The casino industry is heating up in anticipation of the takeover of the Trump Taj Mahal by Casino Wildz. Analysts are expecting big things from the new ownership, which they say is poised to breathe new life into the struggling property.

Casino Wildz is a relative newcomer to the gambling scene, but it has made a big splash with its innovative and exciting games. The company already operates a number of successful casinos, and its entry into the Taj Mahal is expected to turn the property around for good.

#  Trump Taj Mahal casino to be re-branded as Casino Wildz

Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal casino is to be re-branded as Casino Wildz. Bosses at the casino say that the name change is part of a major refurbishment project which will see it become "the most exciting and dynamic gaming destination on the east coast."

The revamp will include a new luxury spa, a nightclub, several restaurants and of course, lots of new gaming machines and tables. The casino is also set to become the first in Atlantic City to offer virtual reality gaming experiences.

"We are really excited about this project," said Casino Wildz CEO, Michael Dominguez. "We want to create an incredible experience for our guests and we believe that the name change, coupled with all the new features we are adding, will do just that."

#  Trump Taj Mahal casino sold to Casino Wildz

The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City has been sold to Casino Wildz. The deal, worth $225 million, is expected to close in the next few months. It will be the first U.S. casino to be owned by a European company.

Casino Wildz is a subsidiary of the Gauselmann Group, a German gaming company that operates casinos, hotels, and other resorts around the world. The Gauselmann Group has agreed to invest an additional $100 million in the Trump Taj Mahal, which will keep it open as a casino and resort.

The Trump Taj Mahal opened in 1990 as one of Donald Trump's most ambitious projects. It was hailed as the "eighth wonder of the world" and was one of the largest and most lavish casinos in Atlantic City. However, it went bankrupt in 2009 and was taken over by Carl Icahn.

Icahn closed the casino in October 2016, blaming New Jersey's refusal to approve his plans for a state-of-the-art gaming floor. He had planned to invest $25 million in the casino but was rejected by state regulators.

The sale to Casino Wildz represents a major turnaround for the Trump Taj Mahal casino. It should provide some relief for Atlantic City, which has been struggling with casino closures and job losses in recent years.
