# Who Was Vegas Card Counting Blackjack: Insights from Ezra Pound

Ezra Pound was an American poet and critic who was also known for his interest in economics and finance. He was one of the earliest advocates of using statistical analysis to gain an edge in gambling. In this article, we will explore the concept of card counting in blackjack and what it means as explained by Pound.

## Understanding Card Counting in Blackjack

Card counting is a strategy used in blackjack to track the ratio of high cards to low cards remaining in the deck. By keeping track of the cards that have been dealt, a player can make better decisions on when to hit, stand, or double down, and increase their chances of winning.

The most common system for card counting is the Hi-Lo system, where high cards (10, J, Q, K, A) are assigned a value of -1 and low cards (2-6) are assigned a value of +1. Cards with a value of 7, 8, and 9 are assigned a value of 0. By adding up the values of the cards that have been dealt, players can determine the ratio of high cards to low cards remaining in the deck.

## Who Was Vegas Card Counting Blackjack?

According to Pound, Vegas card counting blackjack was a practice that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s in Las Vegas. Skilled players would use card counting techniques to gain an edge over the house and win at blackjack.

Pound notes that card counting is not illegal, but casinos do not like it because it can significantly increase a player's odds of winning. Many casinos have taken measures to prevent card counting, such as using multiple decks of cards, shuffling the deck more frequently, and banning players who are suspected of using the strategy.

## Conclusion

Understanding card counting in blackjack is an important part of playing the game effectively. By following insights from Pound, players can recognize the significance of card counting and develop strategies to increase their odds of winning. However, it is important to remember that card counting is not allowed in all casinos and can result in being banned from playing the game. With insights from Pound, you can take your blackjack skills to the next level and become a more successful and knowledgeable player.
