#  How to play Gold Express?

Gold Express is a railroad-themed game for iPhone and iPad. It looks strikingly similar to the classic board game, Railroad Tycoon. The objective of the game is to manage a railway company, making money by transporting goods and passengers between cities.

The game begins with a tutorial that takes you through the basics of gameplay. You can then choose to play as one of four railways companies: America, Europe, Asia or Australia. Each company has its own unique set of goals to achieve during the game.

The main map screen shows a depiction of the world, with cities connected by railways. To start playing, you need to select a city to begin your journey from. From there, you can add new stops along your route, and purchase locomotives and cars to transport cargo.

Cargo can be transported between cities either by rail or ship. Ships are used to transport goods between coastal cities, while trains are used for inland transportation. Trains have the advantage of being able to carry more cargo than ships, but they are also more expensive to operate.

You also need to be careful not to exceed your maximum capacity for each type of cargo. If you do, your profits will suffer!

The money you earn from transporting goods can be used to upgrade your railway infrastructure, including adding new tracks and stations, and purchasing better locomotives and cars.

As you progress through the game, you'll face challenges that require you to make tough decisions about what goods to transport and how best to route your trains. Can you make your company profitable enough to become the world's largest railway operator?
