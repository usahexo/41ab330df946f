#  When will the New York Giants open their new casino?

The New York Giants are a professional football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Giants are members of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which it shares with the New Jersey Jets in an arrangement known as "cross-lease."

The Giants were founded on August 12, 1925, by Tim Mara and his brother Chris. They joined the NFL in 1920 as the Morgan Athletic Club. In 1927, the club was renamed the New York Giants. The franchise has won four NFL championships: two before the Super Bowl era (1927 and 1934), and two since (1956 and 1986).

The Giants have played in six Super Bowls, winning four: XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2012). According to Pro-Football-Reference.com, the Giants have played in more Super Bowls than any other NFL franchise. The team's heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is among the oldest in the NFL.

The casino industry is a massive industry that generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. Gambling is a popular activity that has been around for centuries. Casinos offer players a variety of games to wager on, including blackjack, craps, roulette, and slot machines. In recent years, online casinos have become increasingly popular.

There are many different types of casinos, from small Native American casinos to large resorts with hundreds of slot machines and table games. There are also "riverboat" casinos that are located on riverboats and allow players to gamble while they cruise down the river. Some states have multiple casinos, while other states only have one.

Casinos are typically built near tourist destinations or big cities. This enables them to draw visitors from all over the country who want to gamble and experience all that a casino has to offer. Las Vegas is known as the "gambling capital of the world" because it has more casinos than any other city on Earth.
