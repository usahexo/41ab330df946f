#  Lenz Shares His Secrets to Enjoying Live Blackjack 

Playing blackjack in a casino can be a fun and exciting experience, but it’s important to know the right way to play if you want to come away a winner. Casino pro Lenz shares his secrets for enjoying live blackjack and getting the most out of your bets.

First, always familiarize yourself with the rules of the game before playing. There’s nothing more frustrating than making a bet and not knowing what you’re supposed to do next!

Next, decide how much money you want to spend on blackjack. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose, because blackjack is a game of chance and you could easily end up losing your entire bankroll.

When choosing which table to play at, pick one that has a lower minimum bet. This gives you more flexibility with your betting and allows you to stay in the game longer even if you hit a bad streak.

If you’re new to blackjack, start by playing basic strategy. This involves making the best possible decision based on the cards you are dealt. You can find lots of information on basic strategy online, or you can ask a dealer for help.

Once you feel comfortable with basic strategy, start making some bigger bets. But always remember: it’s better to win small amounts consistently than it is to go for big wins that could easily turn into big losses.

Lenz also recommends avoiding games that are being fueled by high-rollers. These games tend to be less favorable for players and offer lower returns on investment.

Above all, have fun! Blackjack can be a thrilling game when played correctly, so enjoy yourself and take your time making decisions. Good luck!
