The three goals of the campaign are to:\n\n1) Eliminate hazardous materials from the health care sector. This includes things like mercury thermometers and PVC medical tubing.\n\n2) Reduce energy consumption by 25 percent. This can be done through things like installing LED lights and using smart technologies to optimize energy use.\n\n3) Divert at least 75 percent of all waste from landfills. This can be done by recycling paper, glass, metal, and plastics, as well as composting organic waste.\n\n#  How will the 12-step approach help organizations achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022?\n\nThe 12-step approach will help organizations achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022 by providing a roadmap to sustainability. The 12 steps are:\n\n1. Establish a leadership team and governance structure\n2. Develop a mission, vision, and values\n3. Assess your environmental footprint\n4. Set reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n5. Implement energy efficiency measures\n6. Procure environmentally friendly products and services\n7. Promote transportation alternatives\n8. Educate staff about climate change and health impacts\n9. Reduce food waste\n10. compost food waste\n11. Invest in renewable energy sources\n12. Measure and report your progress\n\n#  What progress has been made since the launch of Health Care Without Harm 2022?\n\nThe Healthcare sector is notorious for being slow to adopt change. However, in the last few years there has been a concerted effort to make healthcare more sustainable. This has been spearheaded by Health Care Without Harm 2022 (HCWH2022), an international coalition of hospitals, health systems, and others committed to creating a healthy and sustainable future for healthcare.\n\n HCWH2022 was formed in response to the Paris Climate Agreement, and its goal is to reduce the environmental footprint of the healthcare sector by 50% by 2022. To do this, HCWH2022 has launched a number of initiatives, including:\n\n-The Healthy Hospital Index: This tool helps hospitals measure and track their progress towards sustainability.\n\n-The Circular Economy in Healthcare Guide: This guide helps hospitals recycle and reuse medical supplies and other hospital waste.\n\n-The Clean Air Campaign: This campaign aims to reduce pollution from healthcare facilities.\n\nProgress has been made since the launch of HCWH2022, but there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, in the United States, only 6% of hospitals are certified as sustainable under HCWH’s criteria. However, there are signs that things are changing, and more hospitals are beginning to adopt sustainable practices.\n\nOne reason for this is that sustainable practices can save money in the long run. For example, by recycling medical supplies instead of buying new ones, hospitals can save millions of dollars each year. And by reducing energy consumption, hospitals can save even more money on electricity costs.\n\nSustainability is not just about saving money though; it’s also about protecting our environment and improving public health. By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we can help mitigate climate change and improve air quality. And by promoting recycling and reusing products, we can reduce waste emissions and help conserve resources.\n\nSo far HCWH2022 has had a positive impact on the healthcare sector, but there is still much work to be done.

The three goals of the campaign are to:\n\n1) Eliminate hazardous materials from the health care sector. This includes things like mercury thermometers and PVC medical tubing.\n\n2) Reduce energy consumption by 25 percent. This can be done through things like installing LED lights and using smart technologies to optimize energy use.\n\n3) Divert at least 75 percent of all waste from landfills. This can be done by recycling paper, glass, metal, and plastics, as well as composting organic waste.\n\n#  How will the 12-step approach help organizations achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022?\n\nThe 12-step approach will help organizations achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022 by providing a roadmap to sustainability. The 12 steps are:\n\n1. Establish a leadership team and governance structure\n2. Develop a mission, vision, and values\n3. Assess your environmental footprint\n4. Set reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n5. Implement energy efficiency measures\n6. Procure environmentally friendly products and services\n7. Promote transportation alternatives\n8. Educate staff about climate change and health impacts\n9. Reduce food waste\n10. compost food waste\n11. Invest in renewable energy sources\n12. Measure and report your progress\n\n#  What progress has been made since the launch of Health Care Without Harm 2022?\n\nThe Healthcare sector is notorious for being slow to adopt change. However, in the last few years there has been a concerted effort to make healthcare more sustainable.

To do this, HCWH2022 has launched a number of initiatives, including:\n\n-The Healthy Hospital Index: This tool helps hospitals measure and track their progress towards sustainability.\n\n-The Circular Economy in Healthcare Guide: This guide helps hospitals recycle and reuse medical supplies and other hospital waste.\n\n-The Clean Air Campaign: This campaign aims to reduce pollution from healthcare facilities.\n\nProgress has been made since the launch of HCWH2022, but there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, in the United States, only 6% of hospitals are certified as sustainable under HCWH’s criteria. However, there are signs that things are changing, and more hospitals are beginning to adopt sustainable practices.\n\nOne reason for this is that sustainable practices can save money in the long run. For example, by recycling medical supplies instead of buying new ones, hospitals can save millions of dollars each year. And by reducing energy consumption, hospitals can save even more money on electricity costs.\n\nSustainability is not just about saving money though; it’s also about protecting our environment and improving public health.
