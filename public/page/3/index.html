Do you have to report your gambling income and pay taxes on it? And what about your losses? Can you deduct them from your taxable income?</p>
<p>The good news is that, in most cases, gambling losses are tax deductible. The bad news is that there are a few hoops you have to jump through to claim them. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling income is usually considered taxable income. This includes not only wins, but also bonuses and other payments from the casino.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can’t just deduct your total losses for the year. You have to itemize them and list the amount of each loss separately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling income. So if you had $1,000 in gambling income for the year, you could only deduct $1,000 in losses. Any excess losses can’t be carried over to future years.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be claimed as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A of your tax return. This means they are subject to the 2% floor, which means that only the first $2,500 of miscellaneous deductions will be allowed (or 2% of your adjusted gross income, whichever is less).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep these things in mind when filing your taxes this year and remember that you don’t have to go it alone. If you have questions about how to claim your gambling losses, consult with a tax professional for help.</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-Most-from-Your-Gambling-Losses-Itemize"><a href="#Get-the-Most-from-Your-Gambling-Losses-Itemize" class="headerlink" title="Get the Most from Your Gambling Losses: Itemize!"></a>Get the Most from Your Gambling Losses: Itemize!</h1><p>When you’re gambling, it’s important to keep track of your losses. This way, you can get the most from them come tax time! One way to do this is by itemizing.</p>
<p>Itemizing means that you list out each and every loss separately. This can be a bit of a hassle, but it’s well worth it because you can then deduct those losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>This can result in some serious savings, so it’s definitely something to consider if you’re a regular gambler. In order to itemize your losses, you’ll need to keep track of the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The date of the loss</li>
<li>The type of game or activity that was lost on</li>
<li>The amount lost</li>
<li>The name of the casino or other business where the loss occurred</li>
<li>The state where the casino or other business is located</li>
<li>Your taxpayer identification number (TIN)</li>
<li>The amount of winnings for the year (if any)</li>
<li>The amount of any expenses related to gambling (such as travel, food, or hotel costs)</li>
<li>Whether or not the gambling activity is considered illegal in the state where it took place</li>
</ol>

If you’re not careful, you might end up losing more money than you intended. Fortunately, there are ways to deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling losses are deductible if you itemize your deductions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can only deduct gambling losses to the extent of your gambling income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To claim your gambling losses, you’ll need to keep track of your winnings and losses throughout the year. This can be done using a Form 1040 Schedule A, Line 28.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generally, you can only claim gambling losses for the year in which they occurred. However, there are some exceptions for bad debts and casualty losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are considered ordinary and necessary expenses for tax purposes.</p>

<h1 id="How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How To Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes"></a>How To Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes</h1><p>If you’re a gambling enthusiast, you’re probably well-acquainted with the tax implications of your hobby. But if you’re not, don’t worry - we’re here to help! Below, we’ll outline how to claim gambling losses on your taxes, as well as some tips to help reduce your taxable income.</p>
<p>When it comes to claiming gambling losses on your taxes, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First and foremost, only gambling losses that exceed your gambling winnings can be claimed as a deduction. In other words, you can’t simply subtract your total losses from your total winnings and call it a day - you have to have incurred more losses than wins in order to claim them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the amount of gambling losses that can be deducted is limited to the amount of taxable income you have for the year. So if you have $10,000 in taxable income but incur $12,000 in gambling losses, only $10,000 of those losses can be deducted.</p>
<p> Finally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that you keep detailed records of all your gambling activity for the year. This includes information on the dates and amounts of all your wins and losses, as well as any expenses related to your gambling activities. If you don’t have this information handy when it’s time to file your taxes, you could run into trouble with the IRS.</p>
<p>So now that you know how to claim gambling losses on your taxes, let’s take a look at some tips for reducing your taxable income. One great way to do this is by contributing money to an IRA or other retirement account. This can help lower your overall taxable income for the year, which in turn reduces the amount of gambling losses that can be deducted.</p>
<p>Another effective strategy is to bunch up your deductible expenses into one or two years instead of spreading them out over several years. This includes things like medical expenses, charitable contributions and yes - even gambling losses. By bunching these deductions together, you can lower your taxable income for the year and potentially increase your chances of claiming a deduction for all of your eligible losses.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’ve recently retired or switched jobs and are no longer itemizing deductions on Schedule A, don’t forget about all those possible deductions available to you on Schedule C! Things like business-related travel expenses and office supplies can add up quickly and significantly reduce your taxable income.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are many ways to reduce your taxable income - it just takes some strategic planning and effort on your part. And if you do happen to incur any significant gambling losses during the year, make sure to claim them on your taxes! By following the tips outlined above, you’ll be one step closer to minimizing their impact on your bottom line.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Claim-a-Tax-Deduction-for-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Can-You-Claim-a-Tax-Deduction-for-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Can You Claim a Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses?"></a>Can You Claim a Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses?</h1><p>There’s no escaping taxes, even when you lose money gambling. But can you claim a tax deduction for gambling losses? The answer is maybe.</p>
<p>To claim a tax deduction for gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions on your federal income tax return. You can only deduct the amount of your losses that exceeds the amount of your winnings. In other words, if you lost $1,000 but won $500, you can only deduct $500 of your losses.</p>
<p>You must also have documentation to support your losses. This can include gambling receipts, statements from the casino or other proof of your winnings and losses.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the IRS does not consider gambling a “deductible expense”. Gambling losses are categorized as “miscellaneous deductions”. This means that they are subject to a 2% limit on the amount of your adjusted gross income (AGI) that can be deducted.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you had an AGI of $50,000 and incurred $2,000 in gambling losses. Your deduction would be limited to $100 (2% x $50,000).</p>
<p>The good news is that the IRS allows you to carry over any unused deduction into future years. So if you don’t use all of your deduction in one year, you can carry it over to the next year.</p>

<p>Las Vegas is often called “Sin City,” and with good reason. It’s a town built on gambling, partying, and excess. For someone struggling with a gambling addiction, Las Vegas can be a very dangerous place. Alcoholics Anonymous defines alcoholism as “a disease that causes alcoholics to drink compulsively even when they know it’s harming them.” For someone struggling with both a gambling addiction and an alcohol addiction, Las Vegas can be a deadly combination. </p>

<ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Offer emotional support.</li>
</ol>

        <h1 id="African-Americans-reap-the-most-rewards-from-Texas-lottery-gambling"><a href="#African-Americans-reap-the-most-rewards-from-Texas-lottery-gambling" class="headerlink" title="African Americans reap the most rewards from Texas lottery gambling"></a>African Americans reap the most rewards from Texas lottery gambling</h1><p>The lottery is the most commonly played form of gambling in the United States. And, for the most part, it is considered a harmless diversion. However, a recent study by economics researchers at Rice University in Houston found that African Americans are significantly more likely to reap rewards from playing the lottery than any other race.</p>
<p>The study, which was funded by the Reason Foundation, used data from 43 states that offered lotteries between 1992 and 2004. The findings showed that the percentage of black winners was consistently two to three times higher than the percentage of white winners, even when income and education levels were taken into account.</p>
<p>In Texas, where 64 percent of the population is white and 12 percent is black, researchers found that blacks were almost four times as likely as whites to win at least $500 in the lottery. They also discovered that blacks were twice as likely to become regular players.</p>
<p>What accounts for this disparity? Some experts suggest that it’s due to a lack of access to other forms of gambling, such as casinos or racetracks. In addition, many low-income African Americans see the lottery as their best chance for getting out of poverty. “Lotteries prey on people’s emotions,” says one critic. “They’re very easy to play and very hard to win.”</p>
<p>Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with playing the lottery as long as people are aware of the odds involved. After all, lotteries are not only popular among blacks but also among whites and Hispanics. And they provide much-needed revenue for cash-strapped state governments.</p>
<p>So what’s your opinion? Is playing the lottery a harmless diversion or a waste of money?</p>
<h1 id="Blacks-dominate-in-Blackjack-21-game-at-the-Azure-Casino"><a href="#Blacks-dominate-in-Blackjack-21-game-at-the-Azure-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Blacks dominate in Blackjack 21 game at the Azure Casino"></a>Blacks dominate in Blackjack 21 game at the Azure Casino</h1><p>The Blackjack 21 game at the Azure Casino is a popular one. And, it is dominated by blacks.</p>
<p>There are several theories as to why this may be the case. One theory is that black players have more experience playing the game. They may also be better at counting cards. This gives them an advantage over other players in the game.</p>
<p>Another theory is that casinos are biased against black players. They may give them worse odds or make it harder for them to win. This could explain why the black players tend to do better in Blackjack 21 games.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the fact remains that blacks dominate this game at the Azure Casino. If you want to increase your chances of winning, it is advisable to play against black opponents rather than white ones.</p>
<h1 id="African-American-players-win-big-bucks-playing-Blackjack-21-in-Texas"><a href="#African-American-players-win-big-bucks-playing-Blackjack-21-in-Texas" class="headerlink" title="African American players win big bucks playing Blackjack 21 in Texas"></a>African American players win big bucks playing Blackjack 21 in Texas</h1><p>In the Lone Star State of Texas, African American players are winning big bucks playing Blackjack 21. According to a recent report, black casino players have won more than $100 million from various casinos in the state since 2012. </p>
<p>The findings were compiled by two professors at Texas Southern University, who analyzed data from more than 1,500 blackjack tables in the state. The study found that black players won nearly 60% of all the money wagered at those tables. In addition, the average black player took home more than $8,000 in winnings during that time period – nearly twice as much as the average white player. </p>
<p>There’s no question that black players are enjoying some serious success when playing Blackjack 21 in Texas casinos. So what’s behind this phenomenon? One possible explanation is that black players are better at the game than their white counterparts. Another possibility is that casinos are discriminating against white players, giving preferential treatment to black players in order to improve their profits. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason, one thing is clear – African American players are winning big bucks playing Blackjack 21 in Texas!</p>
<h1 id="Why-black-Texans-are-benefiting-more-from-lottery-gambling-than-any-other-group"><a href="#Why-black-Texans-are-benefiting-more-from-lottery-gambling-than-any-other-group" class="headerlink" title="Why black Texans are benefiting more from lottery gambling than any other group"></a>Why black Texans are benefiting more from lottery gambling than any other group</h1><p>Across the United States, lottery gambling is becoming an increasingly popular way to gamble. While the overall popularity of lotteries is on the rise, some groups are benefiting more from lottery gambling than others.</p>
<p>One such group is black Texans. In fact, black Texans are benefiting more from lottery gambling than any other group in the state. In 2016, for example, tickets purchased by black Texans generated nearly $100 million in revenue for the Texas Lottery Commission – more than any other racial or ethnic group in the state.</p>
<p>What accounts for this disproportionate benefit? One possible explanation is that black Texans are simply more likely to play the lottery than other groups. This may be due, in part, to the fact that lotteries have been marketed specifically to minority groups in recent years.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that black Texans are more likely to win big prizes than other groups. This may be due, in part, to the fact that lotteries have been designed to be especially appealing to low-income individuals and minorities.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that black Texans are benefitting a great deal from lottery gambling. And while there’s no guarantee that this trend will continue in the future, it’s worth keeping an eye on nonetheless.</p>
<h1 id="How-black-communities-are-winning-big-with-texas-lotto-gambling"><a href="#How-black-communities-are-winning-big-with-texas-lotto-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How black communities are winning big with texas lotto gambling"></a>How black communities are winning big with texas lotto gambling</h1><p>Despite what some may believe, black communities are winning big with texas lotto gambling. In fact, many people in these communities are using gambling as a way to secure their financial futures.</p>
<p>For starters, gambling provides black communities with an opportunity to make money. This is something that is not always easily accessible to those living in these neighborhoods. With gambling, black residents have a chance to make money off of the games they play and the bets they place.</p>
<p>In addition, gambling can also help black residents build their credit scores. This is important, as having a good credit score can help improve one’s quality of life. By gambling, black residents can work on improving their credit score and getting closer to the American dream.</p>
<p>Lastly, gambling can provide much-needed entertainment for black residents.Many times, black communities lack quality entertainment options. Gambling can help fill that void and provide residents with hours of fun and excitement.</p>
<p>So, while some may believe that gambling is a negative activity, the truth is that it can be very positive for black communities. If used correctly, gambling can help improve the lives of those living in these neighborhoods in a myriad of ways.</p>

Quarterback Marcus Mariota had a big day, completing 19 of 26 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. The Titans defense was also impressive, limiting the Jaguars to just 16 points and forcing three turnovers.</p>
<p>With the win, the Titans improve to 8-6 on the season and remain in contention for a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. They will next face the Los Angeles Rams (11-3) on Saturday night.</p>
<p>“We knew this was a must-win game,” said Titans linebacker Avery Williamson. “We’re still alive in the playoff race, and we’re going to keep fighting until the end.”</p>
<p>The Jaguars (10-4) meanwhile suffered their first loss of the season at home and saw their lead in the AFC South shrink to just one game. They will next face the Seattle Seahawks (8-6) on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h1 id="Mariota-leads-Titans-to-another-comeback-victory"><a href="#Mariota-leads-Titans-to-another-comeback-victory" class="headerlink" title="Mariota leads Titans to another comeback victory"></a>Mariota leads Titans to another comeback victory</h1><p>Marcus Mariota led the Titans to another comeback victory on Sunday, October 16th, against the Indianapolis Colts. After trailing by as many as 18 points in the game, the Titans rallied to win 36-22.</p>
<p>Mariota was efficient throughout the game, completing 23 of 32 passes for 306 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for another touchdown. The Titans’ running game was ineffective, however, averaging just 2.8 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The Titans will need to rely on Mariota’s arm more in the coming weeks, with running back DeMarco Murray sidelined with a hamstring injury. Murray is expected to miss at least one week.</p>
<p>Tennessee will next face the Cleveland Browns on October 22nd.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-dominate-Browns-in-blowout-victory"><a href="#Titans-dominate-Browns-in-blowout-victory" class="headerlink" title="Titans dominate Browns in blowout victory"></a>Titans dominate Browns in blowout victory</h1><p>In a game that was never close, the Tennessee Titans cruised to an easy victory over the Cleveland Browns Sunday.</p>
<p>Marcus Mariota had a big day, throwing for three touchdowns and running for another. The Titans defense also played well, holding the Browns to just 10 points.</p>
<p>“We wanted to come out and make a statement today,” Mariota said after the game. “And I think we did that.”</p>
<p>It was the Titans’ most dominant performance of the season, and it moved them into first place in the AFC South.</p>
<p>Next up for Tennessee is a matchup with the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<h1 id="Murray-rushes-for-over-100-yards-in-win-over-Bengals"><a href="#Murray-rushes-for-over-100-yards-in-win-over-Bengals" class="headerlink" title="Murray rushes for over 100 yards in win over Bengals"></a>Murray rushes for over 100 yards in win over Bengals</h1><p>Veteran running back DeMarco Murray ran wild against the Cincinnati Bengals in a 27-10 victory, piling up over 100 yards on the ground.</p>
<p>Murray got off to a fast start, ripping off a 38-yard run on the team’s opening drive. He would end up with 111 yards on the day, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The offensive line deserves a lot of credit for Murray’s success, as they opened up huge holes for him to run through. The win was a great team effort for the Titans, who improved to 5-4 on the season.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota also played well, throwing for 204 yards and two touchdowns. Rookie receiver Corey Davis had another big game, catching six passes for 78 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Titans will look to keep the momentum going next week when they travel to Indianapolis to take on the Colts.</p>
<h1 id="Henry-has-breakout-game-as-Titans-take-down-Falcons"><a href="#Henry-has-breakout-game-as-Titans-take-down-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Henry has breakout game as Titans take down Falcons"></a>Henry has breakout game as Titans take down Falcons</h1><p>In a matchup of two teams playoff bound for very different reasons, the Titans came out victorious 34-20. The Falcons are sitting at 6-4 and in control of their NFC South destiny, while the Titans are 4-6 but still alive in the AFC playoff race.</p>
<p>For the Titans, the win comes thanks largely to the breakout performance by quarterback Henry. Henry completed 17 of 23 passes for 323 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a jaw-dropping 73-yard touchdown to Corey Davis that iced the game late. It was by far Henry’s best performance as a pro, and it could not have come at a better time for the Titans.</p>
<p>The Falcons were led by Matt Ryan, who completed 24 of 42 passes for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, Atlanta’s usually vaunted offense was held in check by the Titans defense, which sacked Ryan 5 times and intercepted him twice.</p>
<p>With the win, the Titans remain in contention for an AFC wild card spot. They will next face the Colts on Sunday Night Football in a game that could determine their postseason fate.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Nevada-sees-surge-in-revenue-from-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-sees-surge-in-revenue-from-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sees surge in revenue from online gambling"></a>Nevada sees surge in revenue from online gambling</h1><p>The U.S. state of Nevada is seeing a surge in revenue from online gambling, with the amount wagered reaching $1.76 billion in the fiscal year 2018.</p>
<p>This figure is up from the $1.3 billion wagered in the fiscal year 2017, and highlights the growing popularity of online gambling in the U.S.</p>
<p>Nevada regulators have been quick to embrace online gambling, and the state now has over 190 authorized Internet gaming operators.</p>
<p>This compares favorably to other states such as New Jersey, which has around 60 authorized operators, and highlights Nevada’s position as a leader in this field.</p>
<p>The rise in online gambling is also benefiting local businesses, with over 3,000 jobs being created in the sector in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>This number is expected to grow further in the coming years as online gambling becomes even more popular.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-revenues-exceed-1-billion-in-the-US"><a href="#Online-gambling-revenues-exceed-1-billion-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling revenues exceed $1 billion in the US"></a>Online gambling revenues exceed $1 billion in the US</h1><p>Online gambling is continuing to grow in popularity in the United States, with revenues now topping $1 billion, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by research firm Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, found that revenue from online gambling was up 28 percent year-over-year in 2015. This brings the total amount of revenue generated from online gambling in the US to $1.06 billion.</p>
<p>Most of this money is being generated from poker and casino games, with players wagering an estimated $2.5 billion on these games in 2015 alone. This is up from $2.1 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that online gambling is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. After all, it offers players a convenient and fun way to gamble on their favorite games from the comfort of their own home. And with so many states now offering legal online gambling options, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p>So what’s driving this growth? One big factor is that more states are legalizing online gambling each year. Currently, 19 states allow some form of online gambling, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. And more states are expected to legalize it in the near future, including California and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth is that the quality of online casinos continues to improve. Players can now find a wide variety of games offered at top-rated casinos, as well as great bonuses and rewards programs. Plus, most casinos offer 24/7 customer support and fast payouts.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a safe and fun way to gamble online, be sure to check out one of the many US-friendly online casinos available today. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-sees-uptick-in-online-gambling-revenues"><a href="#Delaware-sees-uptick-in-online-gambling-revenues" class="headerlink" title="Delaware sees uptick in online gambling revenues"></a>Delaware sees uptick in online gambling revenues</h1><p>Delaware is one of the states that has seen an uptick in online gambling revenues, according to recent figures released by the state’s Department of Finance.</p>
<p>Online gambling is legal in Delaware, and the state has seen healthy growth in this area in recent years. In 2017, online gambling revenues totaled $7.3 million, which was up from $5.5 million in 2016. This represented a 30% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>The growth in online gambling revenue was due largely to an increase in the number of people who are using their smartphones to gamble. In 2017, the number of people using their smartphones to gamble doubled from the previous year.</p>
<p>The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement also reported that internet gaming revenue generated by casino operators increased by 25% in 2017. This was due largely to an increase in the number of people playing blackjack and roulette online.</p>
<p>Delaware first legalized online gambling in 2012, and it has been one of the most successful states in terms of implementing this type of gaming. The state has seen continued growth in this area, and there is likely more growth to come as more people become comfortable with gambling online.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-leads-the-pack-in-online-gambling-revenues"><a href="#New-Jersey-leads-the-pack-in-online-gambling-revenues" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey leads the pack in online gambling revenues"></a>New Jersey leads the pack in online gambling revenues</h1><p>In the US, New Jersey is by far the biggest online gambling revenue generator, accounting for more than half of the country’s total. This is thanks to a decade-long legal battle that has made the state a haven for online gaming.</p>
<p> Pennsylvania comes in second, with California a distant third. So why are these states leading the pack? The short answer is that they have legalized and regulated online gambling, giving players a safe and legal place to gamble online.</p>
<p>Other states have been slower to adopt online gambling, presumably due to concerns about its potential impact on society and the economy. But with revenue from traditional casino gaming on the decline, it’s no surprise that more states are starting to open up to online gambling.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling has been impressive. In 2007, just $82 million was wagered online in the United States. By 2017, that number had ballooned to $5.8 billion. And it’s only going to keep growing as more states legalize and regulate it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the casino industry? Will brick-and-mortar casinos soon become obsolete? It’s too early to say for sure, but it’s clear that online gambling is here to stay. And as more states legalize it, the casino industry will need to adapt or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-and-New-Jersey-are-the-only-states-with-legal-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-and-New-Jersey-are-the-only-states-with-legal-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada and New Jersey are the only states with legal online gambling"></a>Nevada and New Jersey are the only states with legal online gambling</h1><ul>
<li>Nevada was the first state to legalize online gambling, in 2013.</li>
<li>New Jersey followed a year later, in 2014.</li>
<li>Both Nevada and New Jersey have seen a boom in online gambling since legalization.</li>
<li>The states have offered a variety of casino games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker.</li>
<li>Nevada and New Jersey are the only two states with legal online gambling.</li>
<li>Other states are considering legalizing online gambling, but no decisions have been made yet.</li>

        <h1 id="Gamblers-Can-Deduct-Up-to-3-000-in-Slot-Machine-Losses-From-Their-Taxes"><a href="#Gamblers-Can-Deduct-Up-to-3-000-in-Slot-Machine-Losses-From-Their-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Can Deduct Up to $3,000 in Slot Machine Losses From Their Taxes"></a>Gamblers Can Deduct Up to $3,000 in Slot Machine Losses From Their Taxes</h1><p>Now that 2018 is coming to a close, many taxpayers are looking for ways to reduce their tax liability. One option that may be available to some gamblers is deducting their slot machine losses from their taxable income.</p>
<p>Generally, taxpayers are allowed to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) passed in December 2017, taxpayers can now deduct up to $3,000 in gambling losses per year, regardless of whether they have any gambling winnings.</p>
<p>The new deduction limit applies not only to slot machines, but also to blackjack, roulette, poker, and all other forms of gambling. It also applies regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes deductions or takes the standard deduction.</p>
<p>Note that the $3,000 limit applies on a per-year basis, not on a per-casino visit or other gambling occasion basis. So even if you lose more than $3,000 in a given year at a particular casino, you can still only deduct up to $3,000 of those losses on your taxes.</p>
<p>In order to claim a deduction for gambling losses, you will need to keep track of your winnings and losses throughout the year. This can be done using IRS Form 1040 Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), which is used to report itemized deductions. If you do not have enough itemized deductions to exceed your standard deduction amount ($12,000 for single filers in 2018), then you cannot claim a deduction for your gambling losses.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the new $3,000 limit applies only to deductions for gambling losses incurred in 2018 and subsequent years. Gambling losses incurred prior to 2018 are still subject to the old limit of netting gambling winnings against losses up to the amount of winnings. So if you only had $2,000 in net gambling winnings in 2017 but lost $4,000 playing slots at various casinos throughout the year, you can only deduct $2,000 of those losses on your 2017 taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Can-Deduct-Gambling-Losses-on-Tax-Returns-Even-If-They-Do-Not-Report-Winnings"><a href="#Gamblers-Can-Deduct-Gambling-Losses-on-Tax-Returns-Even-If-They-Do-Not-Report-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Can Deduct Gambling Losses on Tax Returns, Even If They Do Not Report Winnings"></a>Gamblers Can Deduct Gambling Losses on Tax Returns, Even If They Do Not Report Winnings</h1><p>Last year, the U.S. Tax Court sided with a taxpayer who wanted to deduct more than $42,000 in gambling losses from his taxes, even though he had not reported any gambling income on his return. In that case, the taxpayer had argued that he should be allowed to deduct his losses because they were related to his trade or business as a gambler.</p>
<p>While the court’s ruling applies only to that specific case, it could provide some relief to other taxpayers who have also lost money gambling but have not reported any winnings. That’s because the court’s ruling establishes that gambling losses can be deducted as long as they are greater than any gambling income that has been reported.</p>
<p>This is good news for gamblers, as it means they can potentially reduce their tax bill by deducting their losses from their taxable income. However, it is important to keep in mind that only expenses that were incurred while gambling can be deducted – things like travel expenses and food and drink costs cannot be deducted.</p>
<p>There are a few other things taxpayers need to know about deducting gambling losses: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling losses can only be deducted if they exceed gambling income. So if you have $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses from your taxes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be itemized on your tax return in order to be deducted. This means you cannot simply claim them as a deduction on your Form 1040 – you will need to file Schedule A and list your losses separately from your other deductions. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses can only be used to reduce taxable income – they cannot be used to offset other types of income, such as wages or investment income. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamblers who are subject to self-employment tax can also deduct their gambling losses from their net earnings from self-employment. This rule applies whether or not the gambler has reported any gambling income on their return. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a gambler and are looking for ways to reduce your tax bill, remember that you can deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income. Just make sure you follow the IRS’s rules carefully so that you don’t run into any problems come tax time.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-of-Your-Gambling-Losses-Can-You-Deduct-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-Much-of-Your-Gambling-Losses-Can-You-Deduct-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How Much of Your Gambling Losses Can You Deduct on Your Taxes?"></a>How Much of Your Gambling Losses Can You Deduct on Your Taxes?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling losses, taxpayers may be able to deduct them on their tax return. However, there are limits on how much you can deduct. </p>
<p>In general, you can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. This means that if you lost $1,000 during the year but only won $500, you can only deduct $500 of your losses. </p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you were in the trade or business of gambling, you may be able to deduct more than your winnings. Or, if you incurred the losses as part of an IRS-approved gambling therapy program, you may be able to deduct all of your losses. </p>
<p>To claim your gambling losses on your taxes, you will need to itemize deductions on Schedule A. Gambling losses are listed as Line 28 on Schedule A. </p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that while deducting your gambling losses may reduce your taxable income, it does not necessarily mean that you will get a refund for that amount. In fact, most people who itemize their deductions end up paying more in taxes than they would if they took the standard deduction. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether or not you can deduction your gambling losses on your taxes, be sure to speak with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="Will-I-Get-audited-if-I-claim-gambling-losses-on-my-tax-return"><a href="#Will-I-Get-audited-if-I-claim-gambling-losses-on-my-tax-return" class="headerlink" title="Will I Get audited if I claim gambling losses on my tax return?"></a>Will I Get audited if I claim gambling losses on my tax return?</h1><p>The reason that you may be asking yourself this question is because you may have recently gone to a casino and lost a lot of money. If this is the case, you may be wondering if you can claim your losses on your tax return. </p>
<p>The good news is that, in most cases, you can. The key thing to know, however, is that you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. This means that, if you choose to claim your gambling losses, you will need to forego taking the standard deduction. </p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that you can only claim gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $1,500, you can only claim $500 in losses on your tax return. </p>
<p>If you are thinking about claiming gambling losses on your tax return, it’s important to speak with a tax professional first. There are certain rules and restrictions that apply, and a professional can help make sure that you are taking all of the proper steps.</p>

Here is a look at how gambling losses can be deducted and what you need to know.</p>
<p>-To claim your gambling losses on your taxes, you need to itemize your deductions. Gambling losses are only deductible if they exceed your winnings for the year.</p>
<p>-Keep track of all of your gambling activity throughout the year. This includes wins and losses from casino games, lottery tickets, poker tournaments, and any other form of gambling. You will need to report your total winnings and losses on Schedule A when you file your tax return.</p>
<p>-If you don’t have documentation to support your gambling losses, the IRS may not allow you to deduct them. It is important to keep accurate records of all of your bets and wagers, including the date, amount, and type of bet. This information will be needed to prove that the losses were incurred in the pursuit of making a profit.</p>
<p>-There are some restrictions on the types of expenses that can be claimed as gambling losses. These include transportation costs, meals, and lodging related to gambling activities. In most cases, you can only deduct those expenses that were necessary for you to participate in gambling activities.</p>
<p>-Gambling losses are considered a “miscellaneous deduction” and are subject to a 2% limit. This means that you can only deduct up to $200 in gambling losses for each year (or $300 if married filing jointly). Any excess losses can be carried over and deducted from income in future years.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Gambling in Stardew Valley"></a>How to Win at Gambling in Stardew Valley</h1><p>If you’re looking to make some extra cash in Stardew Valley, gambling may be the way to do it. There are a few different ways to gamble in the game, but each one has the potential to earn you some valuable rewards. In this guide, we’ll show you how to win at gambling in Stardew Valley, so you can rake in the profits!</p>
<p>The first type of gambling you’ll encounter in Stardew Valley is at the casino. The casino is located in the desert, and you’ll need to complete a few tasks before you can access it. Once you’ve been granted access, there are a few different games you can play: blackjack, slots, and poker.</p>
<p>In blackjack, your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The higher your score, the more money you’ll earn. In slots, simply match up three symbols to win. And in poker, try to beat your opponent’s hand using the five cards dealt to you.</p>
<p>All three of these games offer the chance to win big rewards, but they’re also all fairly risky. If you’re looking for a more reliable way to make money in Stardew Valley, there are other options available.</p>
<p>One such option is mining. Mining can be a bit slow and tedious at times, but if you stick with it you can make a modest profit. Another option is fishing; although it may not be as lucrative as mining, it’s a lot more relaxing!</p>
<p>Finally, no discussion of making money in Stardew Valley would be complete without mentioning crops. Growing crops can be a bit time consuming, but if done correctly it can be very profitable. The best way to maximize your profits is by growing high-value crops like cranberries and melons.</p>
<p>So what’s the best way to make money in Stardew Valley? The answer depends on your preferences and playing style. But with a little bit of effort, any of the methods we’ve outlined above can help you bring in some extra cash!</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Way-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley"><a href="#The-Best-Way-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley" class="headerlink" title="The Best Way to Win at Gambling in Stardew Valley"></a>The Best Way to Win at Gambling in Stardew Valley</h1><p>When it comes to gambling in Stardew Valley, there is no one definitive way to come out ahead. However, there are a few tips that can help you increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that the house always has the edge. This means that over time, you will lose money if you gamble regularly. However, there are ways to minimize your losses and even occasionally earn a profit.</p>
<p>One of the most important things is to know which games give you the best chance of winning. The games with the lowest house edge are slot machines, followed by blackjack, then roulette. This means that if you want to have the best chance of winning, these are the games to focus on.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that you can’t ever win at other games – it just means that your odds are slightly worse. So if you want to play craps or poker, for example, go ahead – but be aware that your chances of winning aren’t as good as they would be playing slots or blackjack.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind is how much money you can afford to lose. It’s never a good idea to gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose – after all, losing always has the potential to set you back financially. So make sure that before you start gambling, you set yourself a limit on how much money you’re willing to bet each round or each game. This will help ensure that you don’t end up risking more money than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Finally, always make sure that you gamble responsibly. Gambling should be enjoyed for its own sake, and not seen as a way to make money. If you find yourself starting to rely on gambling for income, or if it’s beginning to cause financial problems for you, then it might be time to stop gambling altogether.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-and-Tricks-for-Winning-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley"><a href="#Tips-and-Tricks-for-Winning-at-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley" class="headerlink" title="Tips and Tricks for Winning at Gambling in Stardew Valley"></a>Tips and Tricks for Winning at Gambling in Stardew Valley</h1><p>Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a gambling novice, there are always new tips and tricks to learn when it comes to winning at Stardew Valley gambling. In this article, we’ll go over some of the best methods for coming out on top – so read on to find out more!</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when gambling is that different games have different odds and house edges. This means that some games are more favourable to the player than others, so it’s worth your time to familiarize yourself with all the different games available before you start playing.</p>
<p>Another important factor to consider is your own personal betting strategy. Do you want to play it safe and bet low amounts on every game, or do you want to take risks by betting larger sums on fewer games? There’s no right or wrong answer, but it’s important to choose a strategy that fits with your personality and gambling style.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered some of the basics, let’s take a look at some specific tips and tricks for winning at Stardew Valley gambling.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Stick to games with high odds<br>One of the best ways to increase your chances of winning is by sticking to games with high odds. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the games are easy – just that the house edge is lower, making them more favourable to the player. So if you want to maximise your chances of coming out on top, focus on playing games like blackjack, roulette and craps rather than slot machines or video poker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the rules<br>If you want to be successful at gambling, it’s important that you know the rules of each game inside out. This way, you won’t waste time trying to figure out how the game works while other players are taking advantage of you. Not only will familiarity help you win more often, but it will also help you make better bets and avoid any costly mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start small and build up slowlyOne mistake new gamblers often make is betting too much money too soon. This can lead to disastrous consequences if you end up losing all your chips early on in the game. Instead, start small and build up your bankroll gradually over time. This way, even if you do lose a few hands in a row, you won’t end up going bankrupt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use strategies for specific gamesThere are a variety of different strategies that can be used for different types of gambling games. For example, blackjack players can use basic strategy charts as a guide for making optimal decisions during gameplay. Roulette players can use systems like Martingale or Fibonacci in order to increase their chances of winning. And craps players can use various betting systems like pass line or don’t pass line in order to minimise their losses. By using specific strategies for each game, you’ll give yourself a better chance of winning more often than not.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Make-Money-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money Gambling in Stardew Valley"></a>How to Make Money Gambling in Stardew Valley</h1><p>Are you looking for ways to make some extra money in Stardew Valley? Are you tired of farming all day and not having enough cash to upgrade your equipment and tools? If so, then gambling may be the solution for you! In this article, we will cover the basics of gambling in Stardew Valley and teach you how to make money gambling.</p>
<p>There are two types of gambling available in Stardew Valley: the casino and the adventuring caves. The casino is the easier option, as it is a simple matter of betting money on a game of chance. The adventuring caves, on the other hand, are more complicated and risky but can provide much greater rewards.</p>
<p>To gamble at the casino, simply walk up to one of the blackjack or poker tables and stand behind the white line. You will then be able to select how much money you want to bet. Note that there is a limit on how much you can bet each day, so be sure to save up your gold if you want to make a large wager.</p>
<p>The games at the casino are fairly simple but can be quite lucrative if you know what you’re doing. Blackjack is a game of chance where you attempt to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than they are. Poker is a game where you compete against other players by forming the best five-card hand possible. Both games have different strategies that can help improve your odds of winning, so be sure to do some research before playing.</p>
<p>The adventuring caves are considerably riskier but offer potentially larger rewards. To enter the caves, you first need an adventurer’s passport which can be obtained from Willy at his shop in Pelican Town. Once you have a passport, simply walk into Smokey’s pub in Zuzu City and talk to Gully to start an adventure!</p>
<p>Adventures in the caves come in three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. The harder the cave, the greater the rewards but also the greater the risk. Each adventure consists of five rounds, with each round lasting one minute. At the end of each round, you will be given a choice of three rewards: gold, items, or experience points (XP). The value of each reward varies depending on the difficulty of the cave and your current level.</p>
<p>There are several things to keep in mind when adventuring in the caves: firstly, your health will not regenerate during an adventure so make sure to bring plenty of healing items with you; secondly, enemies can deal quite a bit of damage so it is important to keep your defenses up; finally, if you die during an adventure you will lose all your loot and will have to start over from scratch!</p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of gambling in Stardew Valley, let’s take a look at some tips for how to make money gambling. First and foremost, it is important to know your limits and only gamble what you can afford to lose. Secondly, always research different strategies for each game before playing; this will give you a better chance of winning some money! Finally, remember that luck plays a big role in gambling – sometimes Lady Luck is on your side while other times she isn’t. Just relax and have fun while gambling; after all, it’s meant to be entertainment rather than a means to make money!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Rich-Playing-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley"><a href="#How-to-Get-Rich-Playing-Gambling-in-Stardew-Valley" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Rich Playing Gambling in Stardew Valley"></a>How to Get Rich Playing Gambling in Stardew Valley</h1><p>Stardew Valley is a farming simulator with role-playing game elements. Created by ConcernedApe, it was initially released for Microsoft Windows in February 2016, and has since been ported to other platforms.</p>
<p>In Stardew Valley, the player inherits a farm from their grandfather and must restore it to production by planting crops, raising livestock, and mining for ores. The player can also engage in various social activities such as fishing, hunting, and attending festivals.</p>
<p>As the game progresses, the player can unlock additional content like new areas to explore, new tasks to complete, and better tools to improve their productivity. The player can also unlock additional buildings that can be used to process raw materials into finished products.</p>
<p>Gambling is one of the many activities that the player can engage in while playing Stardew Valley. There are two different types of gambling available in the game: horseracing and craps.</p>
<p>Horseracing is available at the stables located near your farm. To participate in a race, you must first buy a horse from the horse trader at the stables. There are several different breeds of horses available for purchase, each with their own unique stats. You can also breed horses together to create offspring with improved stats.</p>
<p>Once you have a horse, you can enter it into races at the stables. Races are held every day except Thursday. To enter a race, you must place a bet on your horse. The higher your bet, the greater your potential payout will be if your horse wins. However, if your horse loses, you will lose your bet money.</p>
<p>Craps is a dice game that can be played at the saloon in town. To play craps, you must first buy some chips from JojaMart or the casino dealer at the saloon. There are several different denominations of chips available for purchase.</p>
<p>The object of craps is to roll certain combinations of dice to achieve certain point values. For example, if you roll a 2 and a 3 (2+3=5), you have scored 5 points and can continue rolling until you either score another 5 or 6 (which would end the round), or until you roll something other than a 5 or 6 (in which case you would lose).</p>
<p>The payouts for various combinations depend on the stakes that you set before starting the game. The higher your stakes, the higher your potential payout will be if you win. However, remember that you can also lose more money if you lose!</p>

        <h1 id="Yale-Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Age-Restrictions-Reduce-Suicide-Rates"><a href="#Yale-Study-Shows-that-Gambling-Age-Restrictions-Reduce-Suicide-Rates" class="headerlink" title="Yale Study Shows that Gambling Age Restrictions Reduce Suicide Rates"></a>Yale Study Shows that Gambling Age Restrictions Reduce Suicide Rates</h1><p>Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 44,000 deaths each year.  A new study from Yale University provides evidence that gambling age restrictions can help reduce suicide rates.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, analyzed data from all 50 states between 1999 and 2016. The findings showed that states with stricter gambling age restrictions had lower suicide rates than states with more lenient laws.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Morgan Philpot, commented on the findings, saying, “Our results suggest that increasing the minimum legal gambling age could help reduce suicide rates in the US.”</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that problem gambling can be a major risk factor for suicide. In fact, problem gamblers are two to three times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.</p>
<p>This latest study provides strong evidence that restricting access to gambling can help protect people from harming themselves. policy makers should consider increasing the minimum legal gambling age as a way to prevent suicides.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Age-restrictions-linked-to-reduced-levels-of-problem-gambling"><a href="#Gambling-Age-restrictions-linked-to-reduced-levels-of-problem-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age restrictions linked to reduced levels of problem gambling"></a>Gambling Age restrictions linked to reduced levels of problem gambling</h1><p>Gambling age restrictions are linked to reduced levels of problem gambling, according to a recent study from the University of British Columbia. The study found that people who gamble at 18 or older are less likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who start gambling at a younger age.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from over 6,000 people in Canada and found that the majority of those who developed a problem with gambling started gambling before they turned 18. In contrast, those who started gambling after they turned 18 were much less likely to have a problem with gambling.</p>
<p>This research provides strong evidence that increasing the minimum legal gambling age could help reduce levels of problem gambling in Canada. It is important to note that this finding is specific to Canada – it is possible that the results would be different in other countries.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans to increase the minimum legal gambling age in Canada, but this issue is sure to be debated in the years ahead. Those who oppose increasing the minimum legal age often argue that it will only push problem gamblers underground and make them more difficult to track and treat. However, the evidence from this study suggests that increasing the minimum legal age could actually help reduce levels of problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Scientific-study-confirms-that-gambling-age-restrictions-save-lives"><a href="#Scientific-study-confirms-that-gambling-age-restrictions-save-lives" class="headerlink" title="Scientific study confirms that gambling age restrictions save lives"></a>Scientific study confirms that gambling age restrictions save lives</h1><p>A study recently published in The Lancet journal has provided compelling evidence that restricting gambling access to those over the age of 21 can save lives. Conducted by a team of international researchers, the study looked at mortality rates in countries with and without gambling age restrictions, finding that those with restrictions had significantly lower rates of problem gambling and suicide.</p>
<p>The study analyzed survey data from nearly 200,000 people in 13 countries, finding that the overall suicide rate was more than three times lower in countries with gambling age restrictions. The rate of problem gambling was also 2.5 times lower in countries with restrictions. “These findings provide convincing evidence for the protective effect of restricting gambling access to adults aged 21 years and older,” concluded the study authors.</p>
<p>Governments around the world are increasingly interested in regulating gambling access, and this latest study provides important evidence that such measures can save lives. “This research further supports calls for governments around the world to restrict gambling access to adults aged 21 years and older,” said lead researcher Dr. Charles Livingston. “It is crucial that we continue to explore the effects of gambling on mental health and suicide so that we can develop better prevention and treatment strategies.”</p>
<h1 id="Study-Gambling-age-restrictions-could-prevent-millions-of-dollars-in-addiction-costs"><a href="#Study-Gambling-age-restrictions-could-prevent-millions-of-dollars-in-addiction-costs" class="headerlink" title="Study: Gambling age restrictions could prevent millions of dollars in addiction costs"></a>Study: Gambling age restrictions could prevent millions of dollars in addiction costs</h1><p>Every day, casinos and other gambling establishments lure in customers with the promise of big payouts. But what often starts as harmless fun can quickly turn into a dangerous addiction that costs millions of dollars in lost productivity and healthcare expenses.</p>
<p>A recent study published in the journal Addiction has attempted to quantify these costs, and finds that gambling age restrictions could prevent up to $7.5 billion in addiction-related costs over the next decade.</p>
<p>Led by Dr. Daniel Ladouceur of Quebec’s Université Laval, the study used data from a number of sources to estimate the financial impact of problem gambling. This included statistics on the prevalence of problem gambling, as well as information on associated healthcare costs and lost productivity.</p>
<p>The results showed that if gambling were restricted to adults aged 21 or older, it would reduce the number of problem gamblers by 9%, saving an estimated $1.5 billion in related healthcare costs and $6 billion in lost productivity.</p>
<p>While this is just one study, it provides strong evidence for the need to strengthen gambling age restrictions. With its potential to prevent billions of dollars in addiction-related costs, this is an issue that policymakers should take seriously.</p>
<h1 id="New-study-shows-that-gambling-age-restrictions-have-a-significant-positive-impact-on-public-health"><a href="#New-study-shows-that-gambling-age-restrictions-have-a-significant-positive-impact-on-public-health" class="headerlink" title="New study shows that gambling age restrictions have a significant positive impact on public health"></a>New study shows that gambling age restrictions have a significant positive impact on public health</h1><p>A recent study has shown that gambling age restrictions have a significant positive impact on public health. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, found that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling from 18 to 21 led to a significant decrease in problem gambling rates.</p>
<p>The study is the first to provide evidence that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling leads to a reduction in problem gambling rates. It looked at data from across 26 different countries, and found that the increase in the minimum legal age for gambling was associated with a decrease in problem gambling rates of between 8 and 16 percent.</p>
<p>The study also found that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling led to a reduction in the number of people who developed problems with their gambling behaviour. The reduction in problem gambling rates ranged from 9 to 22 percent, depending on the country studied.</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings, lead author Dr. Marco D’Errico said: “Our findings suggest that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling could be an effective measure to reduce problem gambling rates and protect public health.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that their findings provide strong evidence in support of increasing the minimum legal age for gambling. They argue that this would be an effective measure to protect public health, as it would help to prevent people from developing problems with their gambling behaviour.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Nevada-Approves-First-US-Online-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Nevada-Approves-First-US-Online-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Approves First US Online Gambling Site"></a>Nevada Approves First US Online Gambling Site</h1><p>In a unanimous vote, Nevada gaming regulators have approved the state’s first legal online gambling site. The web-based operation, which is expected to go live in early 2013, will be offered through the Delaware North casino company. It will initially offer blackjack and poker games to players located in Nevada and New Jersey, with plans to expand into other states that have legalized online gambling.</p>
<p>The approval of the new site comes as no surprise, as Nevada has been at the forefront of efforts to legalize online gambling. In 2011, the state became the first in the nation to pass a law allowing for such activity. And late last year, it reached an agreement with New Jersey to allow their residents access to each other’s online gambling sites.</p>
<p>Nevada’s move is seen as a way to help bolster the state’s faltering gaming industry. With casinos struggling to compete against growing states like California and Texas, officials believe that legalizing and regulating online gambling will help keep some of that business within Nevada’s borders.</p>
<p>“It is an important day for the state of Nevada,” said Republican state senator Greg Brower. “This gives us an opportunity to keep our industry strong and protect our jobs.”</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling contend that it is a safe and secure form of entertainment that can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 18. And they argue that it can be a valuable tool for helping problem gamblers control their behavior.</p>
<p>Opponents, however, say that online gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also warn that it could be used by criminals and terrorists to launder money or finance their activities.</p>
<p>Despite such concerns, momentum is growing for legalized online gambling in the United States. Earlier this month, two influential congressional committees held hearings on the issue and urged federal lawmakers to take action.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Online-Gambling-Gets-Green-Light"><a href="#Delaware-Online-Gambling-Gets-Green-Light" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Online Gambling Gets Green Light"></a>Delaware Online Gambling Gets Green Light</h1><p>The state of Delaware has officially given the thumbs up for online gambling, becoming the first in the US to do so.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was approved last week, allows for online poker and casino games to be played by residents of the state. The move is expected to bring in around $7 million in additional revenue for Delaware each year.</p>
<p>Governor Jack Markell said that the new law would “keep Delaware at the forefront of this rapidly growing industry” and that it would create new jobs in the state.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill was voiced by a number of religious groups, who argued that it would lead to increased addiction and social problems. However, lawmakers sided with Governor Markell, who said that such concerns were unfounded.</p>
<p>Delaware joins a growing list of countries that have legalized online gambling, including Spain, Italy and France. In the United States, only Nevada currently offers online gambling, although New Jersey is set to follow suit later this year.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Authorizes-First-Eight-Internet-Casinos"><a href="#New-Jersey-Authorizes-First-Eight-Internet-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Authorizes First Eight Internet Casinos"></a>New Jersey Authorizes First Eight Internet Casinos</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, New Jersey authorized its first eight internet casinos. This move makes New Jersey the third state in the US to offer legal and regulated online casino gambling.</p>
<p>The eight casinos that were approved are:<br>Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa; Golden Nugget Atlantic City; Tropicana Casino And Resort; The Resorts Casino Hotel; Caesars Atlantic City; Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City; Ocean Resort Casino (formerly Revel); and Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City.<br>Each of these casinos now has the ability to offer online versions of their land-based games, including slots, table games, and poker. In addition, they will also be able to offer sports betting services once regulations have been finalized.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the internet casino gambling market in New Jersey will be worth $1.5 billion annually. This is welcome news for the state’s struggling casino industry, which has seen a decline in revenue over the past few years.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Launches-Nation’s-Fourth-Online-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Launches-Nation’s-Fourth-Online-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Launches Nation’s Fourth Online Gambling Site"></a>Pennsylvania Launches Nation’s Fourth Online Gambling Site</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) launched the fourth online gambling site in the nation. The site, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.pa.playerscards.com/">www.pa.playerscards.com</a>, will allow residents of the state to play casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots from their home computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>According to PGCB Executive Director Kevin O’Toole, the site went live at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning and “has performed exceptionally well.” He noted that there was a “robust registration process” and that players were eager to start gambling online.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the nation to offer online gambling when Governor Tom Wolf signed the legislature’s gaming expansion bill into law in October of 2017. The other states with online gambling sites are Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new Pennsylvania site offers both free play and real money versions of its casino games. In order to play for real money, players must be 21 years of age or older and must physically be within the borders of Pennsylvania. Players can deposit money into their accounts with any major credit card or through a number of third-party payment processors.</p>
<p>The PGCB has said that it plans to launch additional online gambling sites in the future, including a site that will offer sports betting.</p>

The company has not yet commented on whether they plan to offer sports betting in other states where it is legal.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts joins a number of other companies who have already started to offer sports betting in Nevada, includingCaesars Entertainment and William Hill US.</p>
<p>This move comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on the legality of sports betting nationwide. A decision is expected by the end of June.</p>

        <h1 id="Delaware-becomes-first-US-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-first-US-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes first US state to legalize online gambling"></a>Delaware becomes first US state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>Delaware has become the first US state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>The law, which came into effect on 1st June, allows residents of Delaware to gamble online on casino games and betting on sports.</p>
<p>Under the new law, players must be at least 21 years old and located in Delaware when they gamble. The state’s three casinos will offer online gambling services, which will be regulated by the Delaware Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Governor Jack Markell said that the new law would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. “This is a great day for Delaware,” he said. “This legislation will bring hundreds of jobs to our state, and provide millions of dollars in new revenue each year.”</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) welcomed the news. “We applaud Governor Markell and the Delaware Legislature for their leadership in making this important step forward,” said AGA CEO Geoff Freeman. “This legislation reflects a growing consensus that Internet gaming can be effectively regulated and offer important consumer protections.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-gambling-regulators-greenlight-first-online-poker-site"><a href="#Nevada-gambling-regulators-greenlight-first-online-poker-site" class="headerlink" title="Nevada gambling regulators greenlight first online poker site"></a>Nevada gambling regulators greenlight first online poker site</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the go ahead for the launch of the first regulated online poker site in the state. The new site, run by Ultimate Poker, will offer real money games to players located within Nevada’s borders.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone for the online poker industry, as it is the first time that a regulated site has been launched in the United States. It is also a big step forward for Ultimate Poker, as they look to establish themselves as a leading player in the market.</p>
<p>Nevada has long been seen as a leader when it comes to gambling regulation, so it is no surprise that they have been one of the first states to legalize online poker. Other states are likely to follow suit in the near future, as lawmakers become more comfortable with the idea of regulating and licensing online poker sites.</p>
<p>This new development could pave the way for substantial growth in the online poker industry. A recent study by H2 Gambling Capital predicted that the global market for online poker will grow from $4.9 billion in 2013 to $8.3 billion by 2017. With Nevada now leading the way in terms of regulation, this growth looks set to continue apace.</p>
<p>Ultimate Poker is well placed to capitalise on this growth, as they are already one of the largest operators in the U.S. market. They have been operational since April 2013, and have built up a large base of players. The launch of their new site in Nevada will only help to further strengthen their position in this competitive market.</p>
<p>There are still some challenges facing online poker operators, most notably taxation and legal uncertainty surrounding player deposits and withdrawals. However, with Nevada now leading the charge in terms of regulation, these challenges are becoming easier to overcome.</p>
<p>Gambling regulators in Nevada have given their stamp of approval to Ultimate Poker’s new online poker site- making it the first regulated site Stateside! This is a landmark decision not just for Ultimate Poker but also for prospective players both inside and outside of Nevada’s borders who’ll soon gain access to one united US-friendly liquidity pool; currently something that Full Tilt/PokerStars can only boast about outside America (albeit without proper regulation). Of course there are still some hurdles that need jumping such as effective taxation measures and dealing with any legal issues attached to depositing/withdrawing money from gambling sites but Ultimate Poker’s successful application should bode well for other companies looking to cater (safely) to American players post-Black Friday crackdown</p>
<h1 id="California-moves-closer-to-legalizing-online-gambling"><a href="#California-moves-closer-to-legalizing-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California moves closer to legalizing online gambling"></a>California moves closer to legalizing online gambling</h1><p>The state of California is one step closer to legalizing online gambling, after the state Assembly approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow people in the state to gamble online.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Democratic assemblyman Adam Gray, would create a system where internet poker and other casino games would be regulated and taxed by the state.</p>
<p>Governor Jerry Brown has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but if he does, it is likely to take effect in early 2018.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in a number of states in the US, including Nevada and New Jersey. However, it is not yet legal in California, which is home to over 39 million people.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state, as well as create jobs. They also say that it would help keep money out of the hands of criminal organizations.</p>
<p>However, opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction problems for some people, and that there are not enough protections in place to prevent minors from gambling online.</p>
<h1 id="WSOP-com-opens-doors-to-New-Jersey-online-poker-players"><a href="#WSOP-com-opens-doors-to-New-Jersey-online-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="WSOP.com opens doors to New Jersey online poker players"></a>WSOP.com opens doors to New Jersey online poker players</h1><p>The much anticipated online poker site WSOP.com has finally opened its doors to New Jersey residents, and players are already logging in to try their luck. This follows the successful legalization of online gambling by New Jersey lawmakers in February 2013.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is a partnership between Caesars Entertainment and 888 Holdings, and is currently the only licensed online poker room available to New Jersey residents. The site offers a wide variety of games, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Stud.</p>
<p>Players must be physically located within the state of New Jersey in order to play on WSOP.com. In addition, players must be at least 21 years old and have an account with a verified banking institution.</p>
<p>The launch of WSOP.com has been eagerly awaited by New Jersey residents, many of whom have fond memories of playing online poker before it was banned in 2011. In fact, New Jersey is one of three states in the US that have legalized online gambling; the others are Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is offering new players a sign-up bonus of $10 worth of free play credit. In addition, players can take advantage of daily and weekly tournaments with prize pools totaling tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>For those looking for some great golf while they’re not busy playing poker, Caesars also owns several world-class golf resorts including Bally’s Atlantic City Resort, Caesars Atlantic City Resort, Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City, Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, and Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-casino-launches-real-money-online-gambling"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casino-launches-real-money-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casino launches real money online gambling"></a>Atlantic City casino launches real money online gambling</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Atlantic City’s first casino to launch real money online gambling is the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa. The casino announced on Monday that it will offer a range of casino games to New Jersey residents from Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Other casinos in Atlantic City are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks. Internet gambling has been legal in New Jersey since November 2013, but Monday’s launch is the first time that residents will be able to gamble online for real money.</p>
<p> gamblers will have access to blackjack, roulette and other table games, as well as slots and video poker machines. There are also a number of betting options for sports fans, including wagering on NFL, NBA and MLB games.</p>
<p>The Borgata website was redesigned specifically for the launch of online gambling and includes a “My Borgata” section, which gives players personal information about their account and gaming history.</p>
<p>Borgata CEO Tom Balance said that the company is “thrilled” to be making its debut in the online gambling market. He added that the company expects its internet casino business to grow rapidly in 2014.</p>
