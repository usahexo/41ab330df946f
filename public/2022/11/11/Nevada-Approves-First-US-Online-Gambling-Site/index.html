        <h1 id="Nevada-Approves-First-US-Online-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Nevada-Approves-First-US-Online-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Approves First US Online Gambling Site"></a>Nevada Approves First US Online Gambling Site</h1><p>In a unanimous vote, Nevada gaming regulators have approved the state’s first legal online gambling site. The web-based operation, which is expected to go live in early 2013, will be offered through the Delaware North casino company. It will initially offer blackjack and poker games to players located in Nevada and New Jersey, with plans to expand into other states that have legalized online gambling.</p>
<p>The approval of the new site comes as no surprise, as Nevada has been at the forefront of efforts to legalize online gambling. In 2011, the state became the first in the nation to pass a law allowing for such activity. And late last year, it reached an agreement with New Jersey to allow their residents access to each other’s online gambling sites.</p>
<p>Nevada’s move is seen as a way to help bolster the state’s faltering gaming industry. With casinos struggling to compete against growing states like California and Texas, officials believe that legalizing and regulating online gambling will help keep some of that business within Nevada’s borders.</p>
<p>“It is an important day for the state of Nevada,” said Republican state senator Greg Brower. “This gives us an opportunity to keep our industry strong and protect our jobs.”</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling contend that it is a safe and secure form of entertainment that can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 18. And they argue that it can be a valuable tool for helping problem gamblers control their behavior.</p>
<p>Opponents, however, say that online gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also warn that it could be used by criminals and terrorists to launder money or finance their activities.</p>
<p>Despite such concerns, momentum is growing for legalized online gambling in the United States. Earlier this month, two influential congressional committees held hearings on the issue and urged federal lawmakers to take action.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Online-Gambling-Gets-Green-Light"><a href="#Delaware-Online-Gambling-Gets-Green-Light" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Online Gambling Gets Green Light"></a>Delaware Online Gambling Gets Green Light</h1><p>The state of Delaware has officially given the thumbs up for online gambling, becoming the first in the US to do so.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was approved last week, allows for online poker and casino games to be played by residents of the state. The move is expected to bring in around $7 million in additional revenue for Delaware each year.</p>
<p>Governor Jack Markell said that the new law would “keep Delaware at the forefront of this rapidly growing industry” and that it would create new jobs in the state.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill was voiced by a number of religious groups, who argued that it would lead to increased addiction and social problems. However, lawmakers sided with Governor Markell, who said that such concerns were unfounded.</p>
<p>Delaware joins a growing list of countries that have legalized online gambling, including Spain, Italy and France. In the United States, only Nevada currently offers online gambling, although New Jersey is set to follow suit later this year.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Authorizes-First-Eight-Internet-Casinos"><a href="#New-Jersey-Authorizes-First-Eight-Internet-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Authorizes First Eight Internet Casinos"></a>New Jersey Authorizes First Eight Internet Casinos</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, New Jersey authorized its first eight internet casinos. This move makes New Jersey the third state in the US to offer legal and regulated online casino gambling.</p>
<p>The eight casinos that were approved are:<br>Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa; Golden Nugget Atlantic City; Tropicana Casino And Resort; The Resorts Casino Hotel; Caesars Atlantic City; Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City; Ocean Resort Casino (formerly Revel); and Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City.<br>Each of these casinos now has the ability to offer online versions of their land-based games, including slots, table games, and poker. In addition, they will also be able to offer sports betting services once regulations have been finalized.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the internet casino gambling market in New Jersey will be worth $1.5 billion annually. This is welcome news for the state’s struggling casino industry, which has seen a decline in revenue over the past few years.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Launches-Nation’s-Fourth-Online-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Launches-Nation’s-Fourth-Online-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Launches Nation’s Fourth Online Gambling Site"></a>Pennsylvania Launches Nation’s Fourth Online Gambling Site</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) launched the fourth online gambling site in the nation. The site, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.pa.playerscards.com/">www.pa.playerscards.com</a>, will allow residents of the state to play casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots from their home computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>According to PGCB Executive Director Kevin O’Toole, the site went live at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning and “has performed exceptionally well.” He noted that there was a “robust registration process” and that players were eager to start gambling online.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the nation to offer online gambling when Governor Tom Wolf signed the legislature’s gaming expansion bill into law in October of 2017. The other states with online gambling sites are Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new Pennsylvania site offers both free play and real money versions of its casino games. In order to play for real money, players must be 21 years of age or older and must physically be within the borders of Pennsylvania. Players can deposit money into their accounts with any major credit card or through a number of third-party payment processors.</p>
<p>The PGCB has said that it plans to launch additional online gambling sites in the future, including a site that will offer sports betting.</p>

The company has not yet commented on whether they plan to offer sports betting in other states where it is legal.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts joins a number of other companies who have already started to offer sports betting in Nevada, includingCaesars Entertainment and William Hill US.</p>
<p>This move comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on the legality of sports betting nationwide. A decision is expected by the end of June.</p>
