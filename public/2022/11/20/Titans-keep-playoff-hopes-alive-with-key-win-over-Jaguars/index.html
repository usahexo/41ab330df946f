Quarterback Marcus Mariota had a big day, completing 19 of 26 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. The Titans defense was also impressive, limiting the Jaguars to just 16 points and forcing three turnovers.</p>
<p>With the win, the Titans improve to 8-6 on the season and remain in contention for a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. They will next face the Los Angeles Rams (11-3) on Saturday night.</p>
<p>“We knew this was a must-win game,” said Titans linebacker Avery Williamson. “We’re still alive in the playoff race, and we’re going to keep fighting until the end.”</p>
<p>The Jaguars (10-4) meanwhile suffered their first loss of the season at home and saw their lead in the AFC South shrink to just one game. They will next face the Seattle Seahawks (8-6) on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h1 id="Mariota-leads-Titans-to-another-comeback-victory"><a href="#Mariota-leads-Titans-to-another-comeback-victory" class="headerlink" title="Mariota leads Titans to another comeback victory"></a>Mariota leads Titans to another comeback victory</h1><p>Marcus Mariota led the Titans to another comeback victory on Sunday, October 16th, against the Indianapolis Colts. After trailing by as many as 18 points in the game, the Titans rallied to win 36-22.</p>
<p>Mariota was efficient throughout the game, completing 23 of 32 passes for 306 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for another touchdown. The Titans’ running game was ineffective, however, averaging just 2.8 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The Titans will need to rely on Mariota’s arm more in the coming weeks, with running back DeMarco Murray sidelined with a hamstring injury. Murray is expected to miss at least one week.</p>
<p>Tennessee will next face the Cleveland Browns on October 22nd.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-dominate-Browns-in-blowout-victory"><a href="#Titans-dominate-Browns-in-blowout-victory" class="headerlink" title="Titans dominate Browns in blowout victory"></a>Titans dominate Browns in blowout victory</h1><p>In a game that was never close, the Tennessee Titans cruised to an easy victory over the Cleveland Browns Sunday.</p>
<p>Marcus Mariota had a big day, throwing for three touchdowns and running for another. The Titans defense also played well, holding the Browns to just 10 points.</p>
<p>“We wanted to come out and make a statement today,” Mariota said after the game. “And I think we did that.”</p>
<p>It was the Titans’ most dominant performance of the season, and it moved them into first place in the AFC South.</p>
<p>Next up for Tennessee is a matchup with the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<h1 id="Murray-rushes-for-over-100-yards-in-win-over-Bengals"><a href="#Murray-rushes-for-over-100-yards-in-win-over-Bengals" class="headerlink" title="Murray rushes for over 100 yards in win over Bengals"></a>Murray rushes for over 100 yards in win over Bengals</h1><p>Veteran running back DeMarco Murray ran wild against the Cincinnati Bengals in a 27-10 victory, piling up over 100 yards on the ground.</p>
<p>Murray got off to a fast start, ripping off a 38-yard run on the team’s opening drive. He would end up with 111 yards on the day, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The offensive line deserves a lot of credit for Murray’s success, as they opened up huge holes for him to run through. The win was a great team effort for the Titans, who improved to 5-4 on the season.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota also played well, throwing for 204 yards and two touchdowns. Rookie receiver Corey Davis had another big game, catching six passes for 78 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Titans will look to keep the momentum going next week when they travel to Indianapolis to take on the Colts.</p>
<h1 id="Henry-has-breakout-game-as-Titans-take-down-Falcons"><a href="#Henry-has-breakout-game-as-Titans-take-down-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Henry has breakout game as Titans take down Falcons"></a>Henry has breakout game as Titans take down Falcons</h1><p>In a matchup of two teams playoff bound for very different reasons, the Titans came out victorious 34-20. The Falcons are sitting at 6-4 and in control of their NFC South destiny, while the Titans are 4-6 but still alive in the AFC playoff race.</p>
<p>For the Titans, the win comes thanks largely to the breakout performance by quarterback Henry. Henry completed 17 of 23 passes for 323 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a jaw-dropping 73-yard touchdown to Corey Davis that iced the game late. It was by far Henry’s best performance as a pro, and it could not have come at a better time for the Titans.</p>
<p>The Falcons were led by Matt Ryan, who completed 24 of 42 passes for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns. However, Atlanta’s usually vaunted offense was held in check by the Titans defense, which sacked Ryan 5 times and intercepted him twice.</p>
<p>With the win, the Titans remain in contention for an AFC wild card spot. They will next face the Colts on Sunday Night Football in a game that could determine their postseason fate.</p>
