        <h1 id="Delaware-becomes-first-US-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-first-US-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes first US state to legalize online gambling"></a>Delaware becomes first US state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>Delaware has become the first US state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>The law, which came into effect on 1st June, allows residents of Delaware to gamble online on casino games and betting on sports.</p>
<p>Under the new law, players must be at least 21 years old and located in Delaware when they gamble. The state’s three casinos will offer online gambling services, which will be regulated by the Delaware Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Governor Jack Markell said that the new law would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. “This is a great day for Delaware,” he said. “This legislation will bring hundreds of jobs to our state, and provide millions of dollars in new revenue each year.”</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) welcomed the news. “We applaud Governor Markell and the Delaware Legislature for their leadership in making this important step forward,” said AGA CEO Geoff Freeman. “This legislation reflects a growing consensus that Internet gaming can be effectively regulated and offer important consumer protections.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-gambling-regulators-greenlight-first-online-poker-site"><a href="#Nevada-gambling-regulators-greenlight-first-online-poker-site" class="headerlink" title="Nevada gambling regulators greenlight first online poker site"></a>Nevada gambling regulators greenlight first online poker site</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the go ahead for the launch of the first regulated online poker site in the state. The new site, run by Ultimate Poker, will offer real money games to players located within Nevada’s borders.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone for the online poker industry, as it is the first time that a regulated site has been launched in the United States. It is also a big step forward for Ultimate Poker, as they look to establish themselves as a leading player in the market.</p>
<p>Nevada has long been seen as a leader when it comes to gambling regulation, so it is no surprise that they have been one of the first states to legalize online poker. Other states are likely to follow suit in the near future, as lawmakers become more comfortable with the idea of regulating and licensing online poker sites.</p>
<p>This new development could pave the way for substantial growth in the online poker industry. A recent study by H2 Gambling Capital predicted that the global market for online poker will grow from $4.9 billion in 2013 to $8.3 billion by 2017. With Nevada now leading the way in terms of regulation, this growth looks set to continue apace.</p>
<p>Ultimate Poker is well placed to capitalise on this growth, as they are already one of the largest operators in the U.S. market. They have been operational since April 2013, and have built up a large base of players. The launch of their new site in Nevada will only help to further strengthen their position in this competitive market.</p>
<p>There are still some challenges facing online poker operators, most notably taxation and legal uncertainty surrounding player deposits and withdrawals. However, with Nevada now leading the charge in terms of regulation, these challenges are becoming easier to overcome.</p>
<p>Gambling regulators in Nevada have given their stamp of approval to Ultimate Poker’s new online poker site- making it the first regulated site Stateside! This is a landmark decision not just for Ultimate Poker but also for prospective players both inside and outside of Nevada’s borders who’ll soon gain access to one united US-friendly liquidity pool; currently something that Full Tilt/PokerStars can only boast about outside America (albeit without proper regulation). Of course there are still some hurdles that need jumping such as effective taxation measures and dealing with any legal issues attached to depositing/withdrawing money from gambling sites but Ultimate Poker’s successful application should bode well for other companies looking to cater (safely) to American players post-Black Friday crackdown</p>
<h1 id="California-moves-closer-to-legalizing-online-gambling"><a href="#California-moves-closer-to-legalizing-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California moves closer to legalizing online gambling"></a>California moves closer to legalizing online gambling</h1><p>The state of California is one step closer to legalizing online gambling, after the state Assembly approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow people in the state to gamble online.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Democratic assemblyman Adam Gray, would create a system where internet poker and other casino games would be regulated and taxed by the state.</p>
<p>Governor Jerry Brown has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but if he does, it is likely to take effect in early 2018.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in a number of states in the US, including Nevada and New Jersey. However, it is not yet legal in California, which is home to over 39 million people.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state, as well as create jobs. They also say that it would help keep money out of the hands of criminal organizations.</p>
<p>However, opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction problems for some people, and that there are not enough protections in place to prevent minors from gambling online.</p>
<h1 id="WSOP-com-opens-doors-to-New-Jersey-online-poker-players"><a href="#WSOP-com-opens-doors-to-New-Jersey-online-poker-players" class="headerlink" title="WSOP.com opens doors to New Jersey online poker players"></a>WSOP.com opens doors to New Jersey online poker players</h1><p>The much anticipated online poker site WSOP.com has finally opened its doors to New Jersey residents, and players are already logging in to try their luck. This follows the successful legalization of online gambling by New Jersey lawmakers in February 2013.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is a partnership between Caesars Entertainment and 888 Holdings, and is currently the only licensed online poker room available to New Jersey residents. The site offers a wide variety of games, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Stud.</p>
<p>Players must be physically located within the state of New Jersey in order to play on WSOP.com. In addition, players must be at least 21 years old and have an account with a verified banking institution.</p>
<p>The launch of WSOP.com has been eagerly awaited by New Jersey residents, many of whom have fond memories of playing online poker before it was banned in 2011. In fact, New Jersey is one of three states in the US that have legalized online gambling; the others are Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is offering new players a sign-up bonus of $10 worth of free play credit. In addition, players can take advantage of daily and weekly tournaments with prize pools totaling tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>For those looking for some great golf while they’re not busy playing poker, Caesars also owns several world-class golf resorts including Bally’s Atlantic City Resort, Caesars Atlantic City Resort, Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City, Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, and Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-casino-launches-real-money-online-gambling"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casino-launches-real-money-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casino launches real money online gambling"></a>Atlantic City casino launches real money online gambling</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Atlantic City’s first casino to launch real money online gambling is the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa. The casino announced on Monday that it will offer a range of casino games to New Jersey residents from Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Other casinos in Atlantic City are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks. Internet gambling has been legal in New Jersey since November 2013, but Monday’s launch is the first time that residents will be able to gamble online for real money.</p>
<p> gamblers will have access to blackjack, roulette and other table games, as well as slots and video poker machines. There are also a number of betting options for sports fans, including wagering on NFL, NBA and MLB games.</p>
<p>The Borgata website was redesigned specifically for the launch of online gambling and includes a “My Borgata” section, which gives players personal information about their account and gaming history.</p>
<p>Borgata CEO Tom Balance said that the company is “thrilled” to be making its debut in the online gambling market. He added that the company expects its internet casino business to grow rapidly in 2014.</p>
