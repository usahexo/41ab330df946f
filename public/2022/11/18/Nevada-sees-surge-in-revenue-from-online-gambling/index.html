      Nevada sees surge in revenue from online gambling

        <h1 id="Nevada-sees-surge-in-revenue-from-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-sees-surge-in-revenue-from-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sees surge in revenue from online gambling"></a>Nevada sees surge in revenue from online gambling</h1><p>The U.S. state of Nevada is seeing a surge in revenue from online gambling, with the amount wagered reaching $1.76 billion in the fiscal year 2018.</p>
<p>This figure is up from the $1.3 billion wagered in the fiscal year 2017, and highlights the growing popularity of online gambling in the U.S.</p>
<p>Nevada regulators have been quick to embrace online gambling, and the state now has over 190 authorized Internet gaming operators.</p>
<p>This compares favorably to other states such as New Jersey, which has around 60 authorized operators, and highlights Nevada’s position as a leader in this field.</p>
<p>The rise in online gambling is also benefiting local businesses, with over 3,000 jobs being created in the sector in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>This number is expected to grow further in the coming years as online gambling becomes even more popular.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-revenues-exceed-1-billion-in-the-US"><a href="#Online-gambling-revenues-exceed-1-billion-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling revenues exceed $1 billion in the US"></a>Online gambling revenues exceed $1 billion in the US</h1><p>Online gambling is continuing to grow in popularity in the United States, with revenues now topping $1 billion, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by research firm Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, found that revenue from online gambling was up 28 percent year-over-year in 2015. This brings the total amount of revenue generated from online gambling in the US to $1.06 billion.</p>
<p>Most of this money is being generated from poker and casino games, with players wagering an estimated $2.5 billion on these games in 2015 alone. This is up from $2.1 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that online gambling is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. After all, it offers players a convenient and fun way to gamble on their favorite games from the comfort of their own home. And with so many states now offering legal online gambling options, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p>So what’s driving this growth? One big factor is that more states are legalizing online gambling each year. Currently, 19 states allow some form of online gambling, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. And more states are expected to legalize it in the near future, including California and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth is that the quality of online casinos continues to improve. Players can now find a wide variety of games offered at top-rated casinos, as well as great bonuses and rewards programs. Plus, most casinos offer 24/7 customer support and fast payouts.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a safe and fun way to gamble online, be sure to check out one of the many US-friendly online casinos available today. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-sees-uptick-in-online-gambling-revenues"><a href="#Delaware-sees-uptick-in-online-gambling-revenues" class="headerlink" title="Delaware sees uptick in online gambling revenues"></a>Delaware sees uptick in online gambling revenues</h1><p>Delaware is one of the states that has seen an uptick in online gambling revenues, according to recent figures released by the state’s Department of Finance.</p>
<p>Online gambling is legal in Delaware, and the state has seen healthy growth in this area in recent years. In 2017, online gambling revenues totaled $7.3 million, which was up from $5.5 million in 2016. This represented a 30% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>The growth in online gambling revenue was due largely to an increase in the number of people who are using their smartphones to gamble. In 2017, the number of people using their smartphones to gamble doubled from the previous year.</p>
<p>The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement also reported that internet gaming revenue generated by casino operators increased by 25% in 2017. This was due largely to an increase in the number of people playing blackjack and roulette online.</p>
<p>Delaware first legalized online gambling in 2012, and it has been one of the most successful states in terms of implementing this type of gaming. The state has seen continued growth in this area, and there is likely more growth to come as more people become comfortable with gambling online.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-leads-the-pack-in-online-gambling-revenues"><a href="#New-Jersey-leads-the-pack-in-online-gambling-revenues" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey leads the pack in online gambling revenues"></a>New Jersey leads the pack in online gambling revenues</h1><p>In the US, New Jersey is by far the biggest online gambling revenue generator, accounting for more than half of the country’s total. This is thanks to a decade-long legal battle that has made the state a haven for online gaming.</p>
<p> Pennsylvania comes in second, with California a distant third. So why are these states leading the pack? The short answer is that they have legalized and regulated online gambling, giving players a safe and legal place to gamble online.</p>
<p>Other states have been slower to adopt online gambling, presumably due to concerns about its potential impact on society and the economy. But with revenue from traditional casino gaming on the decline, it’s no surprise that more states are starting to open up to online gambling.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling has been impressive. In 2007, just $82 million was wagered online in the United States. By 2017, that number had ballooned to $5.8 billion. And it’s only going to keep growing as more states legalize and regulate it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the casino industry? Will brick-and-mortar casinos soon become obsolete? It’s too early to say for sure, but it’s clear that online gambling is here to stay. And as more states legalize it, the casino industry will need to adapt or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-and-New-Jersey-are-the-only-states-with-legal-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-and-New-Jersey-are-the-only-states-with-legal-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada and New Jersey are the only states with legal online gambling"></a>Nevada and New Jersey are the only states with legal online gambling</h1><ul>
<li>Nevada was the first state to legalize online gambling, in 2013.</li>
<li>New Jersey followed a year later, in 2014.</li>
<li>Both Nevada and New Jersey have seen a boom in online gambling since legalization.</li>
<li>The states have offered a variety of casino games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker.</li>
<li>Nevada and New Jersey are the only two states with legal online gambling.</li>
<li>Other states are considering legalizing online gambling, but no decisions have been made yet.</li>
