A new study from Yale University provides evidence that gambling age restrictions can help reduce suicide rates.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, analyzed data from all 50 states between 1999 and 2016. The findings showed that states with stricter gambling age restrictions had lower suicide rates than states with more lenient laws.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Morgan Philpot, commented on the findings, saying, “Our results suggest that increasing the minimum legal gambling age could help reduce suicide rates in the US.”</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that problem gambling can be a major risk factor for suicide. In fact, problem gamblers are two to three times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.</p>
<p>This latest study provides strong evidence that restricting access to gambling can help protect people from harming themselves. policy makers should consider increasing the minimum legal gambling age as a way to prevent suicides.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Age-restrictions-linked-to-reduced-levels-of-problem-gambling"><a href="#Gambling-Age-restrictions-linked-to-reduced-levels-of-problem-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age restrictions linked to reduced levels of problem gambling"></a>Gambling Age restrictions linked to reduced levels of problem gambling</h1><p>Gambling age restrictions are linked to reduced levels of problem gambling, according to a recent study from the University of British Columbia. The study found that people who gamble at 18 or older are less likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who start gambling at a younger age.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from over 6,000 people in Canada and found that the majority of those who developed a problem with gambling started gambling before they turned 18. In contrast, those who started gambling after they turned 18 were much less likely to have a problem with gambling.</p>
<p>This research provides strong evidence that increasing the minimum legal gambling age could help reduce levels of problem gambling in Canada. It is important to note that this finding is specific to Canada – it is possible that the results would be different in other countries.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans to increase the minimum legal gambling age in Canada, but this issue is sure to be debated in the years ahead. Those who oppose increasing the minimum legal age often argue that it will only push problem gamblers underground and make them more difficult to track and treat. However, the evidence from this study suggests that increasing the minimum legal age could actually help reduce levels of problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Scientific-study-confirms-that-gambling-age-restrictions-save-lives"><a href="#Scientific-study-confirms-that-gambling-age-restrictions-save-lives" class="headerlink" title="Scientific study confirms that gambling age restrictions save lives"></a>Scientific study confirms that gambling age restrictions save lives</h1><p>A study recently published in The Lancet journal has provided compelling evidence that restricting gambling access to those over the age of 21 can save lives. Conducted by a team of international researchers, the study looked at mortality rates in countries with and without gambling age restrictions, finding that those with restrictions had significantly lower rates of problem gambling and suicide.</p>
<p>The study analyzed survey data from nearly 200,000 people in 13 countries, finding that the overall suicide rate was more than three times lower in countries with gambling age restrictions. The rate of problem gambling was also 2.5 times lower in countries with restrictions. “These findings provide convincing evidence for the protective effect of restricting gambling access to adults aged 21 years and older,” concluded the study authors.</p>
<p>Governments around the world are increasingly interested in regulating gambling access, and this latest study provides important evidence that such measures can save lives. “This research further supports calls for governments around the world to restrict gambling access to adults aged 21 years and older,” said lead researcher Dr. Charles Livingston. “It is crucial that we continue to explore the effects of gambling on mental health and suicide so that we can develop better prevention and treatment strategies.”</p>

But what often starts as harmless fun can quickly turn into a dangerous addiction that costs millions of dollars in lost productivity and healthcare expenses.</p>
<p>A recent study published in the journal Addiction has attempted to quantify these costs, and finds that gambling age restrictions could prevent up to $7.5 billion in addiction-related costs over the next decade.</p>
<p>Led by Dr. Daniel Ladouceur of Quebec’s Université Laval, the study used data from a number of sources to estimate the financial impact of problem gambling. This included statistics on the prevalence of problem gambling, as well as information on associated healthcare costs and lost productivity.</p>
<p>The results showed that if gambling were restricted to adults aged 21 or older, it would reduce the number of problem gamblers by 9%, saving an estimated $1.5 billion in related healthcare costs and $6 billion in lost productivity.</p>
<p>While this is just one study, it provides strong evidence for the need to strengthen gambling age restrictions. With its potential to prevent billions of dollars in addiction-related costs, this is an issue that policymakers should take seriously.</p>

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, found that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling from 18 to 21 led to a significant decrease in problem gambling rates.</p>
<p>The study is the first to provide evidence that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling leads to a reduction in problem gambling rates. It looked at data from across 26 different countries, and found that the increase in the minimum legal age for gambling was associated with a decrease in problem gambling rates of between 8 and 16 percent.</p>
<p>The study also found that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling led to a reduction in the number of people who developed problems with their gambling behaviour. The reduction in problem gambling rates ranged from 9 to 22 percent, depending on the country studied.</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings, lead author Dr. Marco D’Errico said: “Our findings suggest that increasing the minimum legal age for gambling could be an effective measure to reduce problem gambling rates and protect public health.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that their findings provide strong evidence in support of increasing the minimum legal age for gambling. They argue that this would be an effective measure to protect public health, as it would help to prevent people from developing problems with their gambling behaviour.</p>
