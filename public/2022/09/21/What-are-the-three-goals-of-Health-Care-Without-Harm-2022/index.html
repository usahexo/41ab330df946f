The three goals of the campaign are to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Eliminate hazardous materials from the health care sector. This includes things like mercury thermometers and PVC medical tubing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduce energy consumption by 25 percent. This can be done through things like installing LED lights and using smart technologies to optimize energy use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Divert at least 75 percent of all waste from landfills. This can be done by recycling paper, glass, metal, and plastics, as well as composting organic waste.</p>
</li>
</ol>

The 12 steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a leadership team and governance structure</li>
<li>Develop a mission, vision, and values</li>
<li>Assess your environmental footprint</li>
<li>Set reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions</li>
<li>Implement energy efficiency measures</li>
<li>Procure environmentally friendly products and services</li>
<li>Promote transportation alternatives</li>
<li>Educate staff about climate change and health impacts</li>
<li>Reduce food waste</li>
<li>compost food waste</li>
<li>Invest in renewable energy sources</li>
<li>Measure and report your progress</li>
</ol>

However, in the last few years there has been a concerted effort to make healthcare more sustainable. This has been spearheaded by Health Care Without Harm 2022 (HCWH2022), an international coalition of hospitals, health systems, and others committed to creating a healthy and sustainable future for healthcare.</p>
<p> HCWH2022 was formed in response to the Paris Climate Agreement, and its goal is to reduce the environmental footprint of the healthcare sector by 50% by 2022. To do this, HCWH2022 has launched a number of initiatives, including:</p>
<p>-The Healthy Hospital Index: This tool helps hospitals measure and track their progress towards sustainability.</p>
<p>-The Circular Economy in Healthcare Guide: This guide helps hospitals recycle and reuse medical supplies and other hospital waste.</p>
<p>-The Clean Air Campaign: This campaign aims to reduce pollution from healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Progress has been made since the launch of HCWH2022, but there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, in the United States, only 6% of hospitals are certified as sustainable under HCWH’s criteria. However, there are signs that things are changing, and more hospitals are beginning to adopt sustainable practices.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that sustainable practices can save money in the long run. For example, by recycling medical supplies instead of buying new ones, hospitals can save millions of dollars each year. And by reducing energy consumption, hospitals can save even more money on electricity costs.</p>
<p>Sustainability is not just about saving money though; it’s also about protecting our environment and improving public health. By reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, we can help mitigate climate change and improve air quality. And by promoting recycling and reusing products, we can reduce waste emissions and help conserve resources.</p>
<p>So far HCWH2022 has had a positive impact on the healthcare sector, but there is still much work to be done. If we want healthcare to be truly sustainable, we need everyone – from individuals to hospitals to governments – to come together and make it a priority. With enough support, I believe that HCWH2022 can achieve its goal of reducing the environmental footprint of healthcare by 50% by 2022</p>
<h1 id="What-challenges-still-need-to-be-addressed-in-order-to-achieve-the-goals-of-Health-Care-Without-Harm-2022"><a href="#What-challenges-still-need-to-be-addressed-in-order-to-achieve-the-goals-of-Health-Care-Without-Harm-2022" class="headerlink" title="What challenges still need to be addressed in order to achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022?"></a>What challenges still need to be addressed in order to achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm 2022?</h1><p>As the global health community looks ahead to 2022, there are certain key challenges that must still be addressed in order to achieve the goals of Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), a coalition of organizations working to make the health care sector more environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>Chief among these is reducing the environmental impact of medical products and devices. In order to achieve this, HCWH is calling for increased innovation in sustainable product design, as well as greater transparency in manufacturing and supply chains.</p>
<p>Another important challenge is improving waste management practices in health care facilities worldwide. According to HCWH, only about one-third of hospitals worldwide have formal waste management programs in place, and many facilities still send hazardous waste to landfills or incinerators. Improving waste management practices will not only help reduce the environmental impact of health care, but also save facilities money.</p>
<p>Finally, HCWH is urging the health care sector to become more energy efficient. In particular, the group is calling for improved data collection and analysis so that hospitals can identify where they are wasting energy and take steps to reduce their usage.</p>
<p>While these challenges are not easy to address, they are ultimately essential if we hope to create a more sustainable health care sector. With concerted effort from organizations like HCWH, we can make significant progress towards a healthier future for us all.</p>

These benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fewer environmental incidents: The number of environmental incidents has decreased by 61 percent since the framework was put into place. This is due in part to the fact that hospitals are now working to reduce their use of chemicals and other hazardous materials.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved patient safety: Implementing the framework has helped improve patient safety by reducing the number of medical errors and infections. In fact, the number of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) has decreased by 63 percent since 2002.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduced energy costs: Hospitals have saved $115 million on energy costs since implementing the framework. This is due to the fact that they have been working to make their facilities more energy efficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many benefits that have been seen as a result of implementing the Health Care Without Harm 2022 framework. It is clear that this framework has had a positive impact on both patients and hospitals alike.</p>
