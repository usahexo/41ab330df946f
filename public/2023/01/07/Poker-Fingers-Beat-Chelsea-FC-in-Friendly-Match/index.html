<p>The first goal of the match came in the 17th minute, when Poker Fingers striker Diego Costa netted one past Chelsea FC goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The blues pulled one back just before halftime through a goal by Pedro, but Poker Fingers restored their lead in the 56th minute with a goal by Willian.</p>
<p>Chelsea FC striker Alvaro Morata scored his side’s second goal in the 66th minute to make it 2-3, but that would be as close as they would get. In the 87th minute, Poker Fingers defender Cesar Azpilicueta scored an own goal to give Chelsea FC a faint glimmer of hope, but it was not enough and they ultimately lost 3-2.</p>
<p>Both teams had several scoring chances throughout the match, but it was Poker Fingers who were able to convert on most of them. This win is sure to give them a lot of confidence as they head into their next Premier League matchup against Southampton.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Players-Trounce-Chelsea-FC-in-Charity-Game"><a href="#Poker-Players-Trounce-Chelsea-FC-in-Charity-Game" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Trounce Chelsea FC in Charity Game"></a>Poker Players Trounce Chelsea FC in Charity Game</h1><p>In a matchup that pitted some of the world’s top poker players against Chelsea Football Club, the poker pros handily won. The game, which was held at the paddock club in Ascot, England last Saturday, was a fundraiser for charity, with all proceeds going to the Chelsea Foundation.</p>
<p>The Chelsea Foundation is the club’s official charity arm and focuses on helping young people in the local area. This year, it plans to invest over £6 million (just over $8 million) in programs that support education, employability, health and social inclusion.</p>
<p>Among those who participated in the poker game were poker legends Daniel Negreanu and Phil Ivey. The two were joined by Gus Hansen, John Juanda, Antonio Esfandiari and Sam Trickett – all of whom are considered among the best poker players in the world.</p>
<p>The Chelsea squad was represented by team captain Gary Cahill and players Cesc Fabregas, Pedro Rodriguez and David Luiz. They were no match for the professional poker players though, losing out 500-200.</p>
<p>Speaking after the game, Cahill said: “It was great fun but we got beat by a better side today. We would like to thank everyone who took part and helped make this such a great event for our Foundation. The money raised will make a real difference to young people’s lives here in west London.”</p>
<p>Poker fans will be able to see many of these same players compete against each other later this month at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Europe event in Rozvadov, Czech Republic.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Stars-Dominate-Chelsea-FC-in-Tournament"><a href="#Poker-Stars-Dominate-Chelsea-FC-in-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="Poker Stars Dominate Chelsea FC in Tournament"></a>Poker Stars Dominate Chelsea FC in Tournament</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, Poker Stars has beaten Chelsea FC in a major tournament. The online poker site outmaneuvered the Premier League soccer team in a grueling two-day event that ended early Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The matchup, which was played at London’s Hippodrome Casino, began on Tuesday evening with Chelsea FC looking to emerge victorious. However, during the first day of play, Poker Stars managed to snag an early lead and never looked back.</p>
<p>The second day of the competition turned into a one-sided affair, as Chelsea FC was unable to make up any ground lost on the first day. In the end, Poker Stars emerged victorious with a final score of 706 points to Chelsea’s 427 points.</p>
<p>PokerStars players were elated following their impressive victory over one of Europe’s top soccer teams. “This is a huge accomplishment for us and we are very proud of our team,” said company spokesperson Jane Doe.</p>
<p>Chelsea FC issued a statement following their defeat, saying they were “disappointed but not discouraged” by the loss. The team vowed to continue training hard and looks forward to competing against Poker Stars again in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Champs-Clobber-Chelsea-FC-in-Exhibition-Match"><a href="#Poker-Champs-Clobber-Chelsea-FC-in-Exhibition-Match" class="headerlink" title="Poker Champs Clobber Chelsea FC in Exhibition Match"></a>Poker Champs Clobber Chelsea FC in Exhibition Match</h1><p>Poker pros Christian Harder, Fedor Holz, and Isaac Haxton clobbered Chelsea Football Club in an exhibition match yesterday. The poker champs were no doubt disdainful of their amateur opponents and ran up the score, winning handily by a final tally of 15-6.</p>
<p>“We wanted to put on a good show for the fans,” said Harder after the match. “And, of course, to remind Chelsea who’s boss.”</p>
<p>The trio of pros was evidently well-prepared for the match, employing a strong poker strategy that stymied Chelsea at nearly every turn.</p>
<p>“They had no answer for our flops,” said Holz. “We just kept betting aggressively and won most of the hands.”</p>
<p>Haxton added: “It was really satisfying to take down a team of amateurs like Chelsea. They clearly didn’t know what they were doing.”</p>
<p>The match was part of a promotional event for upcoming London Poker Festival, which will be held at the Hippodrome Casino from October 12-22.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Hold’em-Players-Hammer-Chelsea-FC-in-Clash"><a href="#Texas-Hold’em-Players-Hammer-Chelsea-FC-in-Clash" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hold’em Players Hammer Chelsea FC in Clash"></a>Texas Hold’em Players Hammer Chelsea FC in Clash</h1><p>In a matchup of two of Europe’s top football clubs, the Texas Hold’em Players put on a clinic, hammering Chelsea FC 7-1.</p>
<p>The game started out as expected, with both teams feeling each other out in the early stages. However, it was the Texas Hold’em Players who took the lead in the 18th minute, when Mohamed Salah fired home from close range.</p>
<p>The Texas Hold’em Players continued to dominate proceedings and they doubled their lead just before halftime, when Roberto Firmino converted from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>The second half was all one-way traffic, as the Texas Hold’em Players ran riot. Firmino netted his second goal of the game in the 47th minute before Sadio Mane made it 4-0 minutes later.</p>
<p>Chelsea FC finally got on the scoresheet in the 71st minute, but it was too little too late as Mane completed his hat-trick a few minutes later to make it 5-1. Salah then made it 6-1 with a wonderful solo goal in the 82nd minute, before Alexsandar Kolarov added a seventh in stoppage time.</p>
<p>It was an emphatic victory for the Texas Hold’em Players and they will now look to continue their good form in their next game against AS Roma.</p>
